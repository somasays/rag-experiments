# Smoke Test Configuration
# Purpose: Quick verification that the chunking pipeline works end-to-end
#
# This minimal config runs 1 strategy with 5 queries to verify:
# - Dataset loading works
# - Chunking produces valid nodes
# - ChromaDB indexing works
# - RAGAS evaluation completes
# - Results are saved correctly
#
# Expected runtime: ~2-3 minutes
