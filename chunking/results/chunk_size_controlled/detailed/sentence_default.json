It progenitor was King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden who proposed the Corpus as a body of Protestant states who were allies, or were potential allies, against Ferdinand II, the Holy Roman Emperor, during the Thirty Years' War.  Gustavus Adolphus proposed that the Corpus Evangelicorum was to be the civil administration alongside the Corpus Bellicum which would be responsible for military concerns.  The presidency of the Corpus Evangelicorum became associated with the Electorate of Saxony.  The Corpus lasted until 1806 and the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire during the Napoleonic Wars.\n\n## Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg\n\nThe Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg (German: \"Herzogtum W\u00fcrttemberg\" ) was a duchy located in the south-western part of the Holy Roman Empire.  It was a member of the Holy Roman Empire from 1495 to 1806.  The dukedom's long survival for nearly four centuries was mainly due to its size, being larger than its immediate neighbors.  During the Protestant Reformation, W\u00fcrttemberg faced great pressure from the Holy Roman Empire to remain a member.  W\u00fcrttemberg resisted repeated French invasions in the 17th and 18th centuries.  W\u00fcrttemberg was directly in the path of French and Austrian armies who were engaged in the long rivalry between the House of Bourbon and the House of Habsburg.  In 1803, Napoleon raised the duchy to be the Electorate of W\u00fcrttemberg of the Holy Roman Empire, and when he abolished the Empire in 1806, the Electorate was elevated as the Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg.\n\n## Army of the Holy Roman Empire\n\nThe Army of the Holy Roman Empire (German \"Reichsarmee\", \"Reichsheer\" or \"Reichsarmatur\"; Latin \"exercitus imperii\") was created in 1422, and came to an end when the Holy Roman Empire was wound up in 1806, as the result of the Napoleonic Wars.  It must not be confused with the Imperial Army (\"Kaiserliche Armee\") of the Emperor.\n\n## French\u2013Habsburg relations\n\nThe term France\u2013Habsburg rivalry (French: \"Rivalit\u00e9 franco-habsbourgeoise\" ; German: \"Habsburgisch-Franz\u00f6sischer Gegensatz\" ) describes the rivalry between the House of Habsburg and the Kingdom of France.  The Habsburgs were the largest and most powerful royal house of the Holy Roman Empire from the Early Modern Period until the First World War.  In addition to holding significant amounts of land and influence within the Holy Roman Empire, the Habsburg dynasty ruled Spain under Charles V.  As the House of Habsburg expanded into western Europe, border friction began with the Kingdom of France, the lands of which extended to the west bank of the Rhine.  The subsequent rivalry became a cause for several major wars, including the Italian Wars, the Thirty Years' War, the Nine Years' War, the War of Spanish Succession, the War of Austrian Succession, and the Napoleonic Wars.\n\n## Battle of Gavinana\n\nThe Battle of Gavinana was a battle in the War of the League of Cognac.  It was fought on 3 August 1530 between the city of Florence and the army of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\n## Frederick William III of Prussia\n\nFrederick William III (German: \"Friedrich Wilhelm III\" ) (3 August 1770 \u2013 7 June 1840) was king of Prussia from 1797 to 1840.  He ruled Prussia during the difficult times of the Napoleonic Wars and the end of the Holy Roman Empire.  Steering a careful course between France and her enemies, after a major military defeat in 1806, he eventually and reluctantly joined the coalition against Napoleon in the \"Befreiungskriege\".  Following Napoleon's defeat he was King of Prussia during the Congress of Vienna which assembled to settle the political questions arising from the new, post-Napoleonic order in Europe.  He was determined to unify the Protestant churches, to homogenize their liturgy, their organization and even their architecture.  The long-term goal was to have fully centralized royal control of all the Protestant churches in the Prussian Union of churches.",

It is symbolized by the slogan unus rex, una lex et grex unus (\"one king, one law, one people\") possibly coined by Johan Skytte, governor-general in Swedish Estonia, Ingria and Livonia.  However, the phrase is also found in the debates on the possible union of Scotland and England in 1607, when Sir Edwyn Sandys noted King James VI & I's view that for a perfect union there should be unus rex, unus grex, una lex.  Most notably, the uniformity policy aimed at abolishing serfdom then common in Estonia, Livonia and the Swedish dominons in the Holy Roman Empire (Ingermanland naturally had a free peasantry).  While implemented in Livonia against the will of the local Baltic German nobles, the Estonian and Pomeranian peasants remained serfs: Estonia had voluntarily submitted to Sweden and thus had been given leeway in keeping the traditional local law code, while Swedish Pomerania had retained its traditional law code when, on behalf of the then ruling Swedish high nobility, the Peace of Westphalia granted it to Sweden while remaining part of the Holy Roman Empire, and not in a formal cession which would have resulted in the implementation of Swedish law.  Swedish law was thus only introduced to Swedish Pomerania after the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806.\n\n## Joachim Whaley\n\nJoachim Whaley (born September 1954 near London) is a historian and linguist at Cambridge University where he is Professor of German History and Thought.

His books on toleration and on the Holy Roman Empire have been translated into German.  He has also written numerous articles, reviews and contributed to handbooks and lexicons of German history and literature.  In 2010 he was awarded a Pilkington Teaching Prize by the University of Cambridge.  Joachim Whaley has been a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society since 1984.  In 2013 he was awarded a LittD by the University of Cambridge for his books and articles on early modern German history.  He was elected Fellow of the British Academy in July 2015.\n\n## Grand duchy\n\nA grand duchy is a country or territory whose official head of state or ruler is a monarch bearing the title of grand duke or grand duchess.  Relatively rare until the abolition of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the term was often used in the official name of countries smaller than most continental kingdoms of modern Europe (e.g., Denmark, Spain, United Kingdom) yet larger than most of the sovereign duchies in the Holy Roman Empire, Italy or Scandinavia (e.g. Anhalt, Lorraine, Modena, Schleswig-Holstein).

During the 19th century there were as many as 14 grand duchies in Europe at once (a few of which were first created as exclaves of the Napoleonic empire but later re-created, usually with different borders, under another dynasty).  Some of these were sovereign and nominally independent (Baden, Hesse and by Rhine, Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Mecklenburg-Strelitz, Oldenburg, Saxe-Weimar and Tuscany), some sovereign but held in personal union with larger realms by a monarch whose grand-dukedom was borne as a subsidiary title (Finland, Luxembourg, Transylvania), some of which were client states of a more powerful realm (Cleves and Berg), and some whose territorial boundaries were nominal and the position purely titular (Frankfurt).\n\n## List of monarchs of Prussia\n\nThe monarchs of Prussia were members of the House of Hohenzollern who were the hereditary rulers of the former German state of Prussia from its founding in 1525 as the Duchy of Prussia.  The Duchy had evolved out of the Teutonic Order, a Roman Catholic crusader state and theocracy located along the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea.  The Teutonic Knights were under the leadership of a Grand Master, the last of whom, Albert, converted to Protestantism and secularized the lands, which then became the Duchy of Prussia.  The Duchy was initially a vassal of the Kingdom of Poland, as a result of the terms of the Prussian Homage whereby Albert was granted the Duchy as part of the terms of peace following the Prussian War.  When the main line of Prussian Hohenzollerns died out in 1618, the Duchy passed to a different branch of the family, who also reigned as Electors of Brandenburg in the Holy Roman Empire.  While still nominally two different territories, Prussia under the suzerainty of Poland and Brandenburg under the suzerainty of the Holy Roman Empire, the two states are known together historiographically as Brandenburg-Prussia.  Following the Second Northern War, a series of treaties freed the Duchy of Prussia from any vassalage to any other state, making it a fully sovereign Duchy in its own right.  This complex situation (where the Hohenzollern ruler of the independent Duchy of Prussia was also a subject of the Holy Roman Emperor as Elector of Brandenburg) laid the eventual groundwork for the establishment of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701.  For diplomatic reasons, the rulers of the state were known as the King in Prussia from 1701 to 1772; largely because they still owed fealty to the Emperor as Electors of Brandenburg, the \"King in Prussia\" title (as opposed to \"King of Prussia\") avoided offending the Emperor.  As the Prussian state grew through several wars and diplomatic moves throughout the 18th century, it became apparent that Prussia had become a Great Power that did not need to submit meekly to the Holy Roman Empire.  By 1772, the pretense was dropped, and the style \"King of Prussia\" was adopted.  Thus it remained until 1871, when in the aftermath of the Franco-Prussian War, the King of Prussia Wilhelm I was crowned German Emperor.  From that point forward, though the Kingdom of Prussia retained its status as a constituent state of the German Empire, all remaining Kings of Prussia also served as German Emperor, and that title took precedence.",

Walker\n\nEdward Garrison Walker, also known as Edwin Garrison Walker (1830\u20131901), was an American artisan in Boston who became an attorney in 1861; he was one of the first black men to pass the Massachusetts bar.  He later became a politician and in 1866, nine years after the state extended the franchise to African-American men, he and Charles Lewis Mitchell were the first two black men elected to the Massachusetts State Legislature.  Walker was the son of Eliza and David Walker, an abolitionist who had written an appeal in 1829 calling for the end of slavery.\n\n## Terry Garrison\n\nTerrence Edward Garrison (born January 19, 1949) is an American politician.

Mark Edward Lundy (then age 43), Christine's husband and Amber's father, was arrested and charged with the murders in February 2001.  In 2002 he was convicted of the murders after a six-week trial and was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum non-parole period of 17 years.  He appealed the conviction to the Court of Appeal; the appeal was rejected and the court increased his non-parole period to 20 years.  In June 2013 the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council heard a further appeal, with the decision reserved after the three day hearing.  In October 2013 the Privy Council unanimously allowed his appeal, quashed the convictions and ordered a re-trial.  In April 2015 a second jury re-convicted him.\n\n## Lane Garrison\n\nLane Edward Garrison (born May 23, 1980) is an American actor best known for the role of David \"Tweener\" Apolskis on the television series \"Prison Break\".

Despite various wars and exoduses (such as that in 1948), roughly one half of the world's Palestinian population continues to reside in historic Palestine, the area encompassing the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and Israel.  In this combined area, as of 2005 , Palestinians constituted 49% of all inhabitants, encompassing the entire population of the Gaza Strip (1.865 million), the majority of the population of the West Bank (approximately 2,785,000 versus close to 500,000 Jewish Israeli citizens which includes about 200,000 in East Jerusalem), and 20.8% of the population of Israel proper as Arab citizens of Israel.  Many are Palestinian refugees or internally displaced Palestinians, including more than a million in the Gaza Strip, three-quarters of a million in the West Bank, and about a quarter of a million in Israel proper.  Of the Palestinian population who live abroad, known as the Palestinian diaspora, more than half are stateless lacking citizenship in any country.  Between 2.1 and 3.24 million of the diaspora population live in neighboring Jordan, over 1 million live between Syria and Lebanon, a quarter of a million in Saudi Arabia, with Chile's half a million representing the largest concentration outside the Arab world.\n\n## David Walker (abolitionist)\n\nDavid Walker (September 28, 1796August 6, 1830) was an outspoken African-American abolitionist, writer and anti-slavery activist.  Though his father was a slave, his mother was free so therefore he was free.  In 1829, while living in Boston, Massachusetts, he published \"An Appeal to the Coloured Citizens of the World\", a call for black unity and self-help in the fight against oppression and injustice.\n\n## The Untamed Youth\n\nThe Untamed Youth were a mid-1980s garage rock band from Columbia, MO, led by Deke Dickerson, who is best known as the frontman for Deke Dickerson & the Eccofonics.  Original members (1986) were Deke Dickerson, Steve Mace, Doug Walker and Joel Trueblood (Alcohol Funnycar, Neko Case).  The Untamed Youth first performed in Columbia at local club The Blue Note in January 1987, and quickly started playing locations throughout the United States between the years 1988\u20131993.  The group disbanded in August 1993, but later reformed for a European tour in 1996 and to record two studio albums for both the Estrus and Norton labels in 1997 and 1998 respectively.

In eight major league seasons, Shorten appeared in 527 games, including 352 as an outfielder, and compiled a .275 career batting average.\n\n## List of Major League Baseball batting champions\n\nIn baseball, batting average (AVG) is a measure of a batter's success rate in achieving a hit during an at bat.  In Major League Baseball (MLB), it is calculated by dividing a player's hits by his at bats (AB).  In MLB, a player in each league wins the \"batting title\" each season for having the highest batting average that year.  The American League (AL) winner is known as the \"Rod Carew American League Batting Champion\", while the National League (NL) leader is designated the \"Tony Gwynn National League Batting Champion\".  Under current rules, a player must have 3.1 plate appearances (PA) per team game (for a total of 502 over the current 162-game season) to qualify for the batting title.  However, if a player's lead in AVG is sufficiently large that enough hitless at bats can be added to reach this requirement and the player still would have the highest batting average, he wins the title.  Tony Gwynn, for example, had 159 hits in 451 ABs in 1996 (.353 average) but only 498 PAs.  Gwynn's batting average would have dropped to .349 (159 hits in 455 ABs) with four hitless ABs added to reach the 502 PA requirement, but this would still have been higher than the next-highest eligible player (.344 average), so he was awarded the 1996 NL batting title.",

The advertising is only partially true; the \"free golf\" is paid for by mandatory amenities fees assessed to all homeowners in The Villages.  The \"free golf\" extends only to the executive golf courses and only to players walking the courses, wherein a greens fee is not assessed.  Players riding golf carts on executive courses pay no greens fee but must pay a trail fee.  Greens fees and trail fees are required on The Villages country club courses (though memberships are provided \"free\" \u2013 again, as part of the amenities fee \u2013 to residents).\n\n## English rule (attorney's fees)\n\nIn the field of law and economics, the English rule (capitalized as English Rule in some jurisdictions) is a rule controlling assessment of attorneys' fees arising out of litigation.  The English rule provides that the party who loses in court pays the other party's attorney's fees.  The English rule contrasts with the American rule, under which each party is generally responsible to pay its own attorneys' fees, unless a statute or contract provides for that assessment.  The rationale for the English rule is that a litigant (whether bringing a claim or defending a claim) is entitled to legal representation and, if successful, should not be left out of pocket by reason of his or her own legal fees.  It should be borne in mind that, in virtually all English civil litigation, damages are merely compensatory.\n\n## Universal transit pass\n\nUniversal Transit Pass or Universal Access Transit Pass (U-Pass) is a program that gives students enrolled in participating post-secondary institutions unlimited access to local transit.  Programs are either funded through mandatory fees that eligible students pay in each term in which they are registered or included in the students' tuition.  For example, the University of Washington and the U-Pass program in Chicago have mandatory U-Pass fees.  Fees are transferred to the local transit authority to fund the required transit service.  Because fees are collected from a large participant base, U-Pass prices are lower than the amount students would otherwise pay for monthly passes or tickets over the course of a term.  The U-Pass price charged to students depends on a variety of factors which differ among municipalities, transit systems and post-secondary institutions.\n\n## Forage value index\n\nThe Forage Value Index is a derived index of the relative change in the previous year\u2019s average monthly rate per head for pasturing cattle on privately owned land in the West.  Used in calculating federal grazing fees.\n\n## Maintenance fee (EPA)\n\nIn United States environmental policy, maintenance fees are the annual fees paid by pesticide manufacturers and formulators to continue registration of pesticide active ingredients and products with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The fees supplement funds appropriated from general U.S. revenues, which cover most administrative costs of the EPA pesticide program under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA; 7 U.S.C. 136a-1).  Fees are deposited into a separate Reregistration and Expedited Processing Fund to offset costs associated with EPA reregistration activities and expedited processing of pesticide registrations that are substantially similar to registrations already in effect or which are for public health pesticides, as defined in FIFRA Section 2(nn).  Congress mandated collection of an annual maintenance fee from each pesticide registrant in 1988 amendments to (P.L. 100-532).  EPA has authority to cancel a registration if a registrant fails to pay the maintenance fee.\n\n## Bundy standoff\n\nThe 2014 Bundy standoff was an armed confrontation between supporters of cattle rancher Cliven Bundy and law enforcement following a 21-year legal dispute in which the United States Bureau of Land Management (BLM) had obtained court orders directing Bundy to pay over $1 million in withheld grazing fees for Bundy's use of federally owned land adjacent to Bundy's ranch in southeastern Nevada.\n\n## Citizens for Constitutional Freedom\n\nCitizens for Constitutional Freedom (C4CF), later also known as People for Constitutional Freedom (P4CF), was the name taken on January 4, 2016, by an armed private U.S. militia that occupied the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Malheur National Wildlife Refuge headquarters in the U.S. state of Oregon from January 2 to February 11, 2016.

The stealth part of the term is that business will often use miscellaneous fees to charge customers without the customers even knowing the fees existed as they were hidden in the fine print of a signed a contract.  The inflation part of the term relates to the up charging of the service without actually providing anything additional.  Since most companies charge a fee to accept payment, a portion gets built into profit and revenue.  A big example of stealth inflation can be overdraft fees from banks surcharges from Telco providers, processing fees and installation fees.  Another form of stealth inflation is devaluation of money by a government, sometimes in order to pay off debt with lower value currency.  The unintended higher cost of imported goods and raw material is passed on to the consumer yet not part of traditional definition of inflation.\n\n## Cliven Bundy\n\nCliven D. Bundy (born April 29, 1946) is an American cattle rancher from Bunkerville, Nevada who is currently federally incarcerated and awaiting trial with bail denied for his role in the 2014 Bundy standoff.  He vocally advocated a philosophy opposed to what he views as federal government overreach.  He is known for having participated in the 2014 Bundy Standoff in Nevada, an armed standoff with federal and state law enforcement over defaulted grazing fees.  Some viewed him as a hero for having led a movement of ranchers to encourage more ranchers to join him in defaulting on their grazing fees as per their federal grazing contracts.  Some considered him to be dangerously provocative.  He is the father of Ammon Bundy, who in 2016 also led another armed standoff against the government, the occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon.\n\n## Sentinel Offender Services\n\nIn 2012, James Hucks filed suit against Sentinel Offender Services after an arrest warrant was issued for his wife because she did not pay all the fees she owed to the company during her probation.  In 2013, Georgia judge Daniel J. Craig ruled that Sentinel had to refund hundreds, and possibly thousands, of people who had paid them, and that private probation companies cannot collect fees from probationers after their probation has expired.  Later that year, Craig granted Sentinel a stay on this ruling, but, despite their attempts to persuade him to back down on it, refused to undo his restrictions.  In 2012, Georgia man Tom Barrett stole a can of beer and was later put on probation with Sentinel after being unable to pay a US$200 fine.  He was later put in jail for two months after being unable to pay Sentinel's startup fee.  As of May 2015, Barrett was suing Sentinel, and was being represented by Augusta attorney Jack Long.  On February 17, 2016, the Southern Center for Human Rights filed a lawsuit against Sentinel on behalf of two women from Cleveland, Georgia who were sentenced to 12 months probation each for not paying fines; the lawsuit also claims both women were told they had to undergo drug tests by a probation officer.",

Universal Records, at the time a brand new start up label, heard of the success of \"Grip\" and signed the band as their second artist ever.  \"Devil Thumbs a Ride\", the 3rd album, had already been recorded and mastered and was about to be manufactured for another self-release when Universal stepped in to sign the band and release the album as-is.  The Hunger had a hit song in 1996, \"Vanishing Cream\", from the \"Devil Thumbs a Ride\" CD, which received heavy airplay on rock stations and reached No. 4 on the Mainstream Rock charts.

Two songs, \"Shoot to Kill\", also from \"Devil Thumbs a Ride\", and \"If\", from \"Grip\", reached No. 42 on Billboard's Dance/Club Play chart.

Tim Huston Stayed with the band from late '05 til 2013.  \"The lifestyle was just getting to overwhelming for me to handle\".  \"If I would have stayed, who knows what would have happened to me.

However, Elliot's \"Make Your Own Kind of Music\" single only just reached the Top 40 at #36.  The similar chart impact of the follow-up single, another Mann/Weil composition entitled \"New World Coming,\" which reached #42, signaled Elliot's challenges in maintaining a profile as a current hitmaker, as the 1960s turned into the 1970s.

After the season, he was selected by the Minnesota Timberwolves as the 16th pick in the NBA Expansion Draft.  After his selection, he said: \"I'm a little stunned right now.  I thought I'd be taken by Orlando because I'd heard some things.  Things like this happen.  That's the kind of year I had.  I'll make the best of the situation.  I look forward to getting out there and meeting with the coach.  I don't even know who it is.\" .  As it turned out, the Timberwolves waived him before the season began, and he never played in the NBA again.\n\n## Firework (song)\n\n\"Firework\" is a song by American singer Katy Perry from her third studio album, \"Teenage Dream\" (2010).

The bulk of these changes were not visible to the public, but were to unsigned legislative designations only.  The primary effect was designating route numbers 1 through 5 for future corridors of the Interstate Highways in Utah.  There were also changes made to a few unsigned highways serving state parks and institutions.  Several other routes were truncated or re-assigned or split into multiple designations to allow the Interstate Highway corridors to have a single route number assigned.  As very little of the Interstate Highway System had been constructed in Utah by 1962, these changes were primarily to support future construction.  There were a number of cases where the legislative change enacted in 1962 would not be built and signed until years later.  Few of the changes made in 1962 are still valid today.  As construction of the Interstate Highway system proceeded, additional changes were made.  The legislature made a larger change in route designations in 1977, eliminating unsigned legislative and concurrences in the process.\n\n## List of auxiliary Interstate Highways\n\nThe auxiliary Interstate Highways (also called three-digit Interstate Highways) are a supplemental subset of the freeways within the Interstate Highway System of the United States.

In New York, Interstate Highways are mostly maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT), with some exceptions.  Unlike in some other states, Interstate Highways in New York are not directly referenced by NYSDOT with their number; instead, the letter \"I\" is suffixed to the number of the route on reference markers and in internal documents.  On the surface, there appears to be numerical duplication between several Interstate Highways and state routes\u2014such as I-86 (I-86) and NY\u00a086\u2014but the \"I\" suffix that is appended to Interstate Highway numbers allows the Interstate Highway and state route to co-exist (\"86I\" versus \"86\", respectively).\n\n## Wytheville, Virginia\n\nWytheville ( ) is a town in, and the county seat of, Wythe County, Virginia, United States.

It is not allowed in U.S. federal courts, as held by \"Dimick vs. Schiedt\", 293 U.S. 474 (1935).  However, \"Dimick\" was decided before \"Erie Railroad Co. v.

It expanded west to Chicago with its 1941 merger with the former Atlantic and Great Western Railroad, also known as the New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio Railroad (NYPANO RR).  Its mainline route proved influential in the development and economic growth of the Southern Tier, including cities such as Binghamton, Elmira, and Hornell.  The Erie Railroad repair shops were located in Hornell, and were Hornell's largest employer.  Hornell was also where Erie's main line split into two routes, one north to Buffalo and the other west to Cleveland.\n\n## Ragan v. Merchants Transfer &amp; Warehouse Co.\n\nRagan v.

The court reasoned that a claim could not be given longer life in federal court than it would have had in a state court while being consistent with the holding in \"Erie Railroad v. Tompkins\".\n\n## Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins\n\nErie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64 (1938) , is a landmark decision by the Supreme Court of the United States in which the Court held that federal courts did not have the judicial power to create general federal common law when hearing state law claims under diversity jurisdiction.  In reaching this holding, the Court overturned almost a century of federal civil procedure case law, and established the foundation of what remains the modern law of diversity jurisdiction as it applies to United States federal courts.\n\n## Same-sex marriage in the Sixth Circuit\n\nOn April 28, 2015, the Supreme Court of the United States heard oral arguments for \"Obergefell v. Hodges\" (Ohio), which was consolidated with three other same-sex marriage cases from the other states in the Sixth Circuit: \"Tanco v. Haslam\" (Tennessee), \"DeBoer v. Snyder\" (Michigan), \"Bourke v. Beshear\" (Kentucky).  On June 26, 2015 the Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit's decision, paving the way for same-sex marriage to become legal in those states, and setting a precedent for the entire nation.  All four states complied with the ruling the same day it was issued before the mandate was actually issued.  Every state in the circuit had a district court ruling against their states' ban, but they were eventually stayed pending appeal.  The Sixth Circuit consists of Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, and Tennessee.  On August 6, 2014, the Sixth Circuit heard oral arguments for same-sex marriage cases from each state within the circuit.  On November 6, 2014, the Sixth Circuit in a split 2-1 decision, upheld the states' same-sex marriage bans, reversing the district courts' rulings that struck them down.  The Sixth Circuit was the first and only circuit court since the landmark ruling \"United States v. Windsor\" to uphold the constitutionality of states' same-sex marriage bans which caused a circuit split.",

In just fourteen years, the Court heard 106 criminal cases, almost as many cases as the Supreme Court had heard in the period from its creation to the appointment of Waite as Chief Justice.  Notable cases include \"United States v. Cruikshank\" (1875), \"United States v. Reese\" (1875), \"Reynolds v. United States\" (1878), \"Wilkerson v. Utah\" (1879), the \"Trade-Mark Cases\" (1879), \"Strauder v. West Virginia\" (1880), \"Pace v. Alabama\" (1883), \"United States v. Harris\" (1883), \"Ex parte Crow Dog\" (1883), \"Hurtado v.

Kansas\" (1887).\n\n## Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Electric Manufacturing Co.\n\nKlaxon Company v. Stentor Electric Manufacturing Company, 313 U.S. 487 (1941) , was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court applied the choice-of-law principles of \"Erie Railroad v. Tompkins\" to conflicts between laws of different states for cases sitting in federal court on diversity jurisdiction.  The court held that a federal court sitting in diversity must apply the choice-of-law doctrine of the forum state to choose between the forum state's law and the other state's law (as distinguished from the federal choice-of-law doctrines which had been used before \"Erie\").\n\n## V.L. v. E.L.\n\nV.L. v. E.L., 577 U.S. ___ (2016) , is a case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States concerning the adoption rights of same-sex couples.  In 2007, a Georgia Superior Court granted adoption rights to V.L., the partner of E.L., the woman who gave birth to their three children.  However, after moving back to Alabama, the couple split up.  E.L. tried to block V.L. from seeing the children, but V.L. filed a lawsuit seeking visitation and other parental rights.  On September 18, 2015, the Supreme Court of Alabama ruled that the state did not have to recognize the adoption judgment, saying that the Georgia court misapplied its own state law.  The court voided the recognition of the adoption judgment in Alabama.  V.L. petitioned the United States Supreme Court to stay the ruling during her appeal and allow her to see her children.  On December 14, 2015, the Supreme Court stayed the ruling pending their action on a petition for a writ of certiorari filed by V.L. On March 7, 2016, the Supreme Court of the United States reversed the decision of the Alabama Supreme Court by per curiam summary disposition.\n\n## Guaranty Trust Co. v. York\n\nGuaranty Trust Co. v. York, 326 U.S. 99 (1945), was a United States Supreme Court case that described how federal courts were to follow state law.

The leader of the organization was Ammon Bundy, son of Cliven D. Bundy, who engaged in a standoff with the federal government over grazing rights on federal land.\n\n## Stealth inflation\n\nStealth inflation is a type of charges or fees created by businesses to gain extra profit and revenue from its customers.  The stealth part of the term is that business will often use miscellaneous fees to charge customers without the customers even knowing the fees existed as they were hidden in the fine print of a signed a contract.  The inflation part of the term relates to the up charging of the service without actually providing anything additional.  Since most companies charge a fee to accept payment, a portion gets built into profit and revenue.  A big example of stealth inflation can be overdraft fees from banks surcharges from Telco providers, processing fees and installation fees.  Another form of stealth inflation is devaluation of money by a government, sometimes in order to pay off debt with lower value currency.  The unintended higher cost of imported goods and raw material is passed on to the consumer yet not part of traditional definition of inflation.\n\n## Cliven Bundy\n\nCliven D. Bundy (born April 29, 1946) is an American cattle rancher from Bunkerville, Nevada who is currently federally incarcerated and awaiting trial with bail denied for his role in the 2014 Bundy standoff.  He vocally advocated a philosophy opposed to what he views as federal government overreach.  He is known for having participated in the 2014 Bundy Standoff in Nevada, an armed standoff with federal and state law enforcement over defaulted grazing fees.  Some viewed him as a hero for having led a movement of ranchers to encourage more ranchers to join him in defaulting on their grazing fees as per their federal grazing contracts.  Some considered him to be dangerously provocative.  He is the father of Ammon Bundy, who in 2016 also led another armed standoff against the government, the occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon.\n\n## Sentinel Offender Services\n\nIn 2012, James Hucks filed suit against Sentinel Offender Services after an arrest warrant was issued for his wife because she did not pay all the fees she owed to the company during her probation.  In 2013, Georgia judge Daniel J. Craig ruled that Sentinel had to refund hundreds, and possibly thousands, of people who had paid them, and that private probation companies cannot collect fees from probationers after their probation has expired.  Later that year, Craig granted Sentinel a stay on this ruling, but, despite their attempts to persuade him to back down on it, refused to undo his restrictions.  In 2012, Georgia man Tom Barrett stole a can of beer and was later put on probation with Sentinel after being unable to pay a US$200 fine.  He was later put in jail for two months after being unable to pay Sentinel's startup fee.  As of May 2015, Barrett was suing Sentinel, and was being represented by Augusta attorney Jack Long.  On February 17, 2016, the Southern Center for Human Rights filed a lawsuit against Sentinel on behalf of two women from Cleveland, Georgia who were sentenced to 12 months probation each for not paying fines; the lawsuit also claims both women were told they had to undergo drug tests by a probation officer.",

In this draft, 18 NBA teams took turns selecting amateur U.S. college basketball players and other eligible players, including international players.  The first two picks in the draft belonged to the teams that finished last in each conference, with the order determined by a coin flip.  The Atlanta Hawks won the coin flip and were awarded the first overall pick, while the Chicago Bulls were awarded the second pick.  The Hawks then traded the first pick to the Houston Rockets before the draft.  The remaining first-round picks and the subsequent rounds were assigned to teams in reverse order of their win\u2013loss record in the previous season.  The New York Knicks forfeited their first-round draft pick due to their illegal signing of George McGinnis whose rights were held by the Philadelphia 76ers.  The 76ers, the Golden State Warriors and the Buffalo Braves also forfeited their second, third and fourth-round pick respectively due to their participation in 1975 supplementary draft American Basketball Association (ABA) players who had never been drafted in the NBA.  A player who had finished his four-year college eligibility was eligible for selection.  If a player left college early, he would not be eligible for selection until his college class graduated.  Before the draft, 26 college underclassmen were declared eligible for selection under the \"hardship\" rule.  13 of them withdrew before the draft, leaving only 13 early entry candidates eligible for selection.  These players had applied and gave evidence of financial hardship to the league, which granted them the right to start earning their living by starting their professional careers earlier.  The draft consisted of 10 rounds comprising the selection of 173 players.  On August 8, 1976, the league also hosted a Dispersal draft for ABA players from the Kentucky Colonels and Spirits of St. Louis, who were not included in the ABA\u2013NBA merger.\n\n## Kevon Looney\n\nKevon Grant Looney (born February 6, 1996) is an American professional basketball player for the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA).

The test is carried out by submersing the appliance into water with one lead attached to the electrical leads of the appliance, and the other lead connected to the water.  It is often carried out on photovoltaic modules in order to qualify them for IEC61646 or IEC61625 certification.\n\n## Water Resistant mark\n\nWater Resistant is a common mark stamped on the back of wrist watches to indicate how well a watch is sealed against the ingress of water.  It is usually accompanied by an indication of the static test pressure that a sample of newly manufactured watches were exposed to in a leakage test.  The test pressure can be indicated either directly in units of pressure such as bar, atmospheres, or (more commonly) as an equivalent water depth in metres (in the United States sometimes also in feet).\n\n## Draize test\n\nThe Draize Test is an acute toxicity test devised in 1944 by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) toxicologists John H. Draize and Jacob M. Spines.  Initially used for testing cosmetics, the procedure involves applying 0.5mL or 0.5g of a test substance to the eye or skin of a restrained, conscious animal, and then leaving it for set amount of time before rinsing it out and recording its effects.  The animals are observed for up to 14 days for signs of erythema and edema in the skin test, and redness, swelling, discharge, ulceration, hemorrhaging, cloudiness, or blindness in the tested eye.  The test subject is commonly an albino rabbit, though other species are used too, including dogs.  The animals are euthanized after testing if the test renders irreversible damage to the eye or skin.  Animals may be re-used for testing purposes if the product tested causes no permanent damage.  Animals are typically reused after a \"wash out\" period during which all traces of the tested product are allowed to disperse from the test site.\n\n## Electrical safety testing\n\nElectrical safety testing is essential to ensure safe operating standards for any product that uses electricity.  Various governments and agencies have developed stringent requirements for electrical products that are sold world-wide.  In most markets it is mandatory for a product to conform to safety standards promulgated by safety and standard agencies such as UL, CE, VDE, CSA, BSI, CCC and so on.  To conform to such standards, the product must pass safety tests such as the high voltage test (also called as Dielectric voltage-withstand test or high potential test), Insulation Resistance Test, Ground (Earth) Bond & Ground Continuity Test & Leakage Current Test (also called as Line Leakage Test, Earth Leakage Current Test, Enclosure Leakage Current Test or Patient Leakage Current Test).  These tests are described in IEC 60335, IEC 61010 and many other national and international standards.\n\n## Anderson\u2013Darling test\n\nThe Anderson\u2013Darling test is a statistical test of whether a given sample of data is drawn from a given probability distribution.  In its basic form, the test assumes that there are no parameters to be estimated in the distribution being tested, in which case the test and its set of critical values is distribution-free.  However, the test is most often used in contexts where a family of distributions is being tested, in which case the parameters of that family need to be estimated and account must be taken of this in adjusting either the test-statistic or its critical values.  When applied to testing whether a normal distribution adequately describes a set of data, it is one of the most powerful statistical tools for detecting most departures from normality.\n\n## Casio G-Shock Frogman\n\nThe Frogman is a high-end model of the Casio G-Shock line of watches.  It was one of the first models of the \"Master of G\" line, a line of G-Shock watches designed for special uses.  The Frogman has an asymmetric shape and is attached eccentrically on its straps.  It is specially made as a diving watch for scuba divers and is the only ISO 6425-compliant G-Shock line with a 200 m Divers rating.\n\n## Hydrostatic test\n\nA hydrostatic test is a way in which pressure vessels such as pipelines, plumbing, gas cylinders, boilers and fuel tanks can be tested for strength and leaks.  The test involves filling the vessel or pipe system with a liquid, usually water, which may be dyed to aid in visual leak detection, and pressurization of the vessel to the specified test pressure.",

The test involves filling the vessel or pipe system with a liquid, usually water, which may be dyed to aid in visual leak detection, and pressurization of the vessel to the specified test pressure.  Pressure tightness can be tested by shutting off the supply valve and observing whether there is a pressure loss.  The location of a leak can be visually identified more easily if the water contains a colorant.  Strength is usually tested by measuring permanent deformation of the container.  Hydrostatic testing is the most common method employed for testing pipes and pressure vessels.  Using this test helps maintain safety standards and durability of a vessel over time.  Newly manufactured pieces are initially qualified using the hydrostatic test.  They are then re-qualified at regular intervals using the \"proof pressure test\" which is also called the \"modified hydrostatic test\".  Testing of pressure vessels for transport and storage of gases is very important because such containers can explode if they fail under pressure.\n\n## Blocked rotor test\n\nA blocked rotor test is conducted on an induction motor.  It is also known as short circuit test, locked rotor test or stalled torque test.  From this test, short circuit current at normal voltage, power factor on short circuit, total leakage reactance, and starting torque of the motor can be found.  The test is conducted at low voltage because if the applied voltage was normal voltage then the current through the stator windings would be high enough to overheat the windings and damage them.  The \"blocked rotor torque test\" is not performed on wound-rotor motors because the starting torque can be varied as desired.  However, a \"blocked rotor current test\" is conducted on squirrel cage rotor motors.\n\n## Test compression\n\nTest compression is a technique used to reduce the time and cost of testing integrated circuits.  The first ICs were tested with test vectors created by hand.  It proved very difficult to get good coverage of potential faults, so Design for testability (DFT) based on scan and automatic test pattern generation (ATPG) were developed to explicitly test each gate and path in a design.  These techniques were very successful at creating high-quality vectors for manufacturing test, with excellent test coverage.  However, as chips got bigger the ratio of logic to be tested per pin increased dramatically, and the volume of scan test data started causing a significant increase in test time, and required tester memory.  This raised the cost of testing.\n\n## G-Shock\n\nG-Shock is a line of watches manufactured by Casio, designed to resist mechanical shock and vibration.  Its full form is Gravitational Shock.  They are designed primarily for sports, military and outdoors-oriented activities; nearly all G-Shocks are digital or a combination of analog or digital and have a stopwatch feature, countdown timer, backlight and water resistance.",

Subsequent releases of \"Cut the Skin\" and \"Shoot to Kill\" gained national exposure on the dance charts and club scene.  \"Never Again\" was self-released as a radio single and quickly rose to the top of Houston Radio Station's 93Q and 96.5 attracting the attention of independent record label Alpha International.  Stephen Bogle produced the single of \"Never Again\".  The band wrote and produced the album \"Leave Me Alone\" but due to the bankruptcy of Alpha International the record sat idle.  It was released but there were no marketing efforts behind it.  After the release of the album, the band sought out drummer Max Schuldberg and they played their first concert as a foursome opening for Peter Murphy at Southern Star Amphitheater.  They played concerts in Texas as a foursome for two years.  Along with the three founders and newest member Max Schuldberg, the band added producer Stephen Bogle as guitarist to complete the line up.  The band recorded and produced \"Grip\" under their own start up label, Gut Records.  \"Grip\" went on to sell 15,000 units with the help of a crafty rework of Bad Company's \"Feel like Makin Love\".  Universal Records, at the time a brand new start up label, heard of the success of \"Grip\" and signed the band as their second artist ever.  \"Devil Thumbs a Ride\", the 3rd album, had already been recorded and mastered and was about to be manufactured for another self-release when Universal stepped in to sign the band and release the album as-is.  The Hunger had a hit song in 1996, \"Vanishing Cream\", from the \"Devil Thumbs a Ride\" CD, which received heavy airplay on rock stations and reached No. 4 on the Mainstream Rock charts.  After two years of constant touring, the band finally stopped to record their second release with Universal Records, \"Cinematic Superthug\".  After only moderate success with the single, \"Moderation\", the band asked to be and was granted a release from their contract from Universal Records.  Two songs, \"Shoot to Kill\", also from \"Devil Thumbs a Ride\", and \"If\", from \"Grip\", reached No. 42 on Billboard's Dance/Club Play chart.  The band has released six albums: two on Universal Records and four on independent labels. Former original drummer (1991-2003) Max Schuldberg (voted 2002's Best Drummer by the Houston Press Music Awards) parted with the band after the five albums in 2003 and moved to Los Angeles.  Former guitarist and two time Grammy Award nominee (remixer, for his work with D.J. Cubanito) Stephen Bogle now Produces artists in the Metal, Electronic, and Pop genres.  In late 2005 Stephen Bogle parted ways with the band, and Tim Huston was quickly picked up.  With having only a few practices with the band they headed on tour with Ten Years.  Tim Huston Stayed with the band from late '05 til 2013.  \"The lifestyle was just getting to overwhelming for me to handle\".  \"If I would have stayed, who knows what would have happened to me.  There was just no off button\".  In 2013, guitarist Raf Rivera joined the lineup, and the band is currently in the process of recording their first new material in over 8 years.\n\n## Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame Covers EP\n\nRock & Roll Hall of Fame Covers EP is EP compilation by American rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers, released in 2012 through iTunes as a digital-only download.  The band first announced the EP through their website on April 19, 2012 with the title \"We Salute You\", although it was changed on the date of the release.  The EP consists of six cover songs, live and in the studio, of previous Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees all who influenced the band.  The EP was released to commemorate the band's own induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012.  All six songs have been previously featured on other releases by the band.

It describes a captured panther behind bars, as it was exhibited in the M\u00e9nagerie of the Jardin des Plantes in Paris.  It is one of Rilke's most famous poems and has been translated into English many times, including by many distinguished translators of Rilke, like Stephen Mitchell, C. F. MacIntyre, J. B. Leishman and Walter Arndt,Jessie Lamont and poets like Robert Bly.\n\n## Ileana Sonnabend\n\nIleana Sonnabend (n\u00e9e Schapira, born October 29, 1914, Bucharest, Romania, died October 21, 2007, New York City) was a dealer of 20th-century art.  The Sonnabend Gallery opened in Paris in 1962 and was instrumental in making American art of the 1960s known in Europe, with an emphasis on American Pop Art.  In 1970, Sonnabend Gallery opened in New York on Madison Avenue and in 1971 relocated to 420 West Broadway in SoHo where it was one of the major protagonists that made SoHo the international art center it remained until the early 1990s.  The gallery was instrumental in making European art of the 1970s known in America, with an emphasis on European conceptual art and Arte Povera.  It also presented American conceptual and minimal art of the 1970s.  In 1986, the so-called \u201cNeo-Geo\u201d show introduced, among others, the artist Jeff Koons.  In the late 1990s, the gallery moved to Chelsea and continues to be active after Sonnabend's death.  The gallery goes on showing the work of artists who rose to prominence in the 1960s and 1970s like Robert Morris, Bernd and Hilla Becher and Gilbert & George as well as more recent artists like Jeff Koons, Rona Pondick, Candida H\u00f6fer, Elger Esser, and Clifford Ross among others.\n\n## 50 Greatest Players in NBA History\n\nThe 50 Greatest Players in National Basketball Association History (also referred to as NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team or NBA's Top 50) were chosen in 1996 to honor the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the National Basketball Association (NBA).  These fifty players were selected through a vote by a panel of media members, former players and coaches, and current and former general managers.  In addition, the top ten head coaches and top ten single-season teams in NBA history were selected by media members as part of the celebration.  The fifty players had to have played at least a portion of their careers in the NBA and were selected irrespective of position played.\n\n## Ker\u010bem Ajax F.C.\n\nKer\u010bem Ajax Football Club is a Gozitan, Malta, football club from the village of Ker\u010bem, which currently plays in the Gozo First Division.

It lies 80\u00a0km north-west of Christchurch.  On the foot of the valley is a swamp which became notable in 1939 as New Zealand's largest paleontological site for moa fossils.  In 1938 the landowners Joseph and Rob Hodgen found three large bones of Dinornis giganteus while they buried a dead horse in the swamp.  They opened this area for excavations and in the early 1940s fossil hunters like Robert Falla, Roger Duff, Robert Cushman Murphy, Jim Eyles, Ron Scarlett and many others began their research work at this site and unearthed the remains of long extinct birds including more than 183 complete moa skeletons and tens of thousands of fossil bone fragments from about 46 species of Modern birds.  The swamp was formed around 18,000 BC and became drained c. 2,000 years ago.  It provided a lush vegetation which attracted five different moa species.\n\n## Robert Parish\n\nRobert Parish (born August 30, 1953) is an American retired basketball center.  He was known for his strong defense, his high arcing jump shooting, and his clutch rebounding late in games.  Robert Parish was elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2003.  In 1996, Parish was also named as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History.  His nickname was The Chief, after the fictitious Chief Bromden, a silent, giant Native American character in the film \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\".  According to Parish, former Celtics forward Cedric Maxwell gave him this nickname because of his stoic nature.  He played an NBA-record 1,611 regular season games in his career.\n\n## The Reform Movement (Upper Canada)\n\nThe Reform movement was rudimentary at the time, the result of loose coalitions that formed around contentious issues.  Support was gained in Parliament through petitions meant to sway MPs.  However, organized Reform activity emerged in the 1830s when Reformers, like Robert Randal, Jesse Ketchum, Peter Perry, Marshall Spring Bidwell, and Dr. William Warren Baldwin, began to emulate the organizational forms of the British Reform Movement, and organized Political Unions under the leadership of William Lyon Mackenzie.  The British Political Unions had successfully petitioned for the Great Reform Act of 1832 that eliminated much political corruption in the English Parliamentary system.  Those who adopted these new forms of public mobilization for democratic reform in Upper Canada were inspired by the more radical Owenite Socialists who led the British Chartist and Mechanics Institute movements.\n\n## Matthew Marks Gallery\n\nMatthew Marks is an art gallery located in the New York City neighborhood of Chelsea and the Los Angeles neighborhood of West Hollywood.  Founded in 1991 by Matthew Marks, it specializes in modern and contemporary art in a variety of media, including: painting, sculpture, photography, installation art, film, and drawings and prints.  It represents established artists like Ellsworth Kelly and Jasper Johns and a younger generation of artists like Robert Gober and Nan Goldin.  The gallery has three exhibition spaces in New York City and two in Los Angeles.\n\n## Washboard (musical instrument)\n\nThere are three general ways of deploying the washboard for use as an instrument.  The first, mainly used by American players like Washboard Chaz of the Washboard Chaz Blues Trio and Ralf Reynolds of the Reynolds Brothers Rhythm Rascals, is to drape it vertically down the chest.  The second, used by European players like David Langlois of the Blue Vipers of Brooklyn and Stephane Seva of Paris Washboard, is to hold it horizontally across the lap, or, for more complex setups, to mount it horizontally on a purpose-built stand.

In this draft, 18 NBA teams took turns selecting amateur U.S. college basketball players and other eligible players, including international players.  The first two picks in the draft belonged to the teams that finished last in each conference, with the order determined by a coin flip.  The Atlanta Hawks won the coin flip and were awarded the first overall pick, while the Chicago Bulls were awarded the second pick.  The Hawks then traded the first pick to the Houston Rockets before the draft.  The remaining first-round picks and the subsequent rounds were assigned to teams in reverse order of their win\u2013loss record in the previous season.  The New York Knicks forfeited their first-round draft pick due to their illegal signing of George McGinnis whose rights were held by the Philadelphia 76ers.  The 76ers, the Golden State Warriors and the Buffalo Braves also forfeited their second, third and fourth-round pick respectively due to their participation in 1975 supplementary draft American Basketball Association (ABA) players who had never been drafted in the NBA.  A player who had finished his four-year college eligibility was eligible for selection.  If a player left college early, he would not be eligible for selection until his college class graduated.  Before the draft, 26 college underclassmen were declared eligible for selection under the \"hardship\" rule.  13 of them withdrew before the draft, leaving only 13 early entry candidates eligible for selection.  These players had applied and gave evidence of financial hardship to the league, which granted them the right to start earning their living by starting their professional careers earlier.  The draft consisted of 10 rounds comprising the selection of 173 players.  On August 8, 1976, the league also hosted a Dispersal draft for ABA players from the Kentucky Colonels and Spirits of St. Louis, who were not included in the ABA\u2013NBA merger.\n\n## Kevon Looney\n\nKevon Grant Looney (born February 6, 1996) is an American professional basketball player for the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA).

Dispatch for the Henderson Sub is known as \"SA\" and operates on AAR58.  There are two crossings near each other, Williams Ave and Nesbitt Lane at Amqui.  From here the Terminal goes south about 2 miles to the Nashville National Cemetery to the first major location, known as Ekin, 000179, where there is a cross over track from number 1 to number 2 track (left to right track).  There is also the first EDD (Defect Detector) at 000179.1.  Few more miles southward, the next major location appears.  At 000181.0, Maplewood is a major location for the Terminal.  From here the regular Terminal goes south to swap crews at Kayne Ave, and the right side, Radnor Cutoff, detours the city and gives yard departures and arrivals direct access to and from Radnor yard to cities like Louisville and Chicago.  The Cutoff runs from Maplewood to Shelby Park double track.  From Shebly the track converges into one to pass the historic Shelby bridge, then it opens back to double track.  From there, the cutoff hits the Intermediates at 0BA187.0 known as Chicken Pike.  The Radnor Cutoff carries the L&N mainline classification of \"0BA\" but meets the main at the same milepost from the Terminal.  At Chicken Pike, trains are staged to await arrival to Radnor yard.  Once they get clearance, speed is decreased to 15, and at 0BA188.1 the EDD (Defect Detector) sounds for departures and arrivals.  This location is known as North Radnor.  The right track diverging from the #2 is known as A-1, it is for departure trains to Chattanooga and Atlanta.  The left track which goes west from the #1 is known as A-2, and serves as a departure track to Memphis, and if the cutoff is out of service, all northbound departures.  The interesting piece of Maplewood is the crossovers that are there to move trains from the Cutoff to the Main.  Both lines remain double track for a while.  The main runs south for 2 more miles until the Intermediate signals at 000183.0.  Commonly trains will stop before Delmas Ave when Kayne Ave is at capacity and await dispatch permission before moving south.",

Further down the double track ends at Glencliff (00J4.9).  Now it runs single for three miles until it hits Danley, which has the D Line connection track, which is an arrival track for incoming Radnor trains from the J Line.  At Danley, the Terminal ends but the same dispatcher handles traffic, \"SC\".  At Oak Street, our main terminal line goes south two miles to 000189.0 known as Criaghead or Vine Hill.  There is a crossover here from #1 to #2 track.  And there is also a connection/delivery track to the Nashville and Eastern Railroad which connects the Tennessee Central Railroad Museum to a major railroad.  Trains sometimes stop on the #2 before Craighead if they are waiting to enter Radnor yard.  Sometimes trains wait on the #1 at the Berry Road crossing if they await arrival to Kayne Ave. At this point, speed has been increased to 30 from 10.  Moving south, the line hits Radnor Yard at 000192.  The #2 track meets the E-Line arrival track which most Memphis trains and locals use.  The B-Line which meets the #1 track is used for departures out of the C yard and local jobs.  At Mayton, 000192.3, the B line meets the #1 track, and there is a crossover track from #2 to #1.  Speed is now at 40.  2 miles south, at 000194.0, South Radnor, the next intersection is present.  This is where the Radnor A yard meets the main.  There is a single departure/arrival track that meets the #2 track along with a crossover from #1 to #2 track.  Commonly, the #2 track south of the signals is used to halt trains.  This location is known as TVA, because of the power station that is adjacent.  From here the Terminal runs about 2.5 miles south until we hit the southern tip.  The tracks converge onto one single main, at 000/0BA196.6 known as Brentwood.  Speed is increased to 50 and jurisdiction to the S.E. dispatcher.  The right track is the main, S&NA North, while the left track is the Nashville Subdivision which runs to Columbia and exchanges freight with the TSRR.

It is the band's first studio album since 1999's \"Windows of Heaven\".  The new album includes cover songs from Irish, American, English, and Latin-American traditions.  The title is a reference to Thomas Jefferson's quotation, \"The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.\"  The idea began in 2003 as \"The Cuba Project\", which was to include classic protest and folk songs recorded in Cuba.  In 2008 the album was finally recorded but in California.  About half of the songs planned for The Cuba Project were used on the final cut, with other songs coming from Jefferson Starship's previous repertoire and another project band member Paul Kantner had planned called \"On the Threshold of Fire.\"  The promotional tour for the album began in late June with shows at Larkspur, California followed by tours in the US and Europe before the album's release, and continued through December 2008 with a further tour in the US and a tour in Japan.  On February 1, 2009, more tour dates and venues were announced by the band's manager Michael Gaiman, with additional plans to continue the tour through 2010 and bring it to Australia and South America.  David Grisman joined the band for the April 2009 tour dates.  The band's promotion for the album ended in June 2009 as the band changed their set-list to Jefferson Airplane's Woodstock Festival material and started touring with the \"Heroes of Woodstock\" through the end of October.\n\n## List of songs recorded by Faith No More\n\nFaith No More, a San Francisco-based band, have recorded approximately 100 songs over the course of their career; this includes material from six studio albums, one live album, and numerous B-side tracks and out-takes.  Faith No More were founded in 1981 as Sharp Young Men, and changed their name to Faith No Man before releasing the 1982 double A-side single \"Quiet in Heaven\" / \"Song of Liberty\".  Upon assuming the name Faith No More, the band's first two full-length albums, \"We Care a Lot\" and \"Introduce Yourself\", were driven mostly by new vocalist Chuck Mosley and the \"metallic guitar\" of Jim Martin, blending elements of rap and heavy metal music.  Mosley was later replaced by Mr. Bungle vocalist Mike Patton, who added lyrics to the already-written music for 1989's \"The Real Thing\".  Their next studio album, \"Angel Dust\", moved away from the band's rap-influenced sound to experiment with different musical genres; a trend which became much more pronounced on the 1995 album \"King for a Day... Fool for a Lifetime\".\n\n## Quiet in Heaven/Song of Liberty\n\n\"Quiet in Heaven\"/\"Song of Liberty\" is a double A-side single, and is the only official release, by Faith No Man (stylised as Faith\u2022No Man\u2022), before the majority of their members quit and formed Faith No More.

Her album, titled \"Quiet Nights,\" was released by 20th Century-Fox Records in 1964.\n\n## For You (Ricky Nelson song)\n\n\"For You\" is a song written by Joe Burke and Al Dubin in 1930.  Dubin wrote the songs for the Broadway show \"42nd Street\".  The Glen Gray Orchestra recorded it with Kenny Sargent doing the vocals.

It appears as the second track of their 1966 album \"A Quick One\".  This song is claimed to be Entwistle's first composition, and became a staple of live shows.  This song, along with \"My Wife\", \"Heaven and Hell\" and \"The Quiet One\", were Entwistle's biggest songs to perform live.  \"The Quiet One\" was written to replace this song and \"My Wife\", which Entwistle had become quite tired of singing.  Though this song was popular, it was not released as a single in the US and the UK.  In Japan, \"Boris the Spider\" was released as the B-side to \"Whiskey Man\" in 1967.",

According to Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine, it is \"\"the first comprehensive, multi-label Waylon Jennings retrospective ever assembled\", comprising ninety-two songs recorded between 1958 and 1994, with selections from the majority of the singer's recording career.  The first track of the box set is the Buddy Holly-produced \"Jole Blon,\" released in 1958, while the last is \"I Do Believe,\" a song produced by Don Was that was included on The Highwaymen's 1995 release, \"The Road Goes on Forever\".  The other material on the box set covers Jennings' career chronologically, with songs ranging from his years on RCA's roster to later compositions from his short-lived stay at Epic Records; it ignores, however, the tracks from Jennings albums released on independent labels.  The majority of the singer's charting singles are included in the package, as are collaborations such as \"Mamas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys\" with Willie Nelson and \"Highwayman\" with The Highwaymen.  A notable addition is the previously unreleased \"The Greatest Cowboy of Them All,\" a 1978 duet with Johnny Cash which was later recorded by Cash alone for \"A Believer Sings the Truth\" (1979) and \"The Mystery of Life\" (1991); two others, \"It's Sure Been Fun\" and \"People in Dallas Got Hair,\" had never been released in the United States.  \"Nashville Rebel\" was released on four CDs, with a 140-page booklet and liner notes by Rich Keinzle and Lenny Kaye.\n\n## Radiohead Box Set\n\nRadiohead Box Set is a box set of the first six studio albums and one live album by the English rock band Radiohead, released on 10 December 2007.  The box set is available as a seven CD box set, a digital download and a 4GB USB Stick.  The box set peaked at #95 in Canada's album charts.\n\n## Mono Masters\n\nMono Masters is a compilation album by the Beatles, and is an alternate, all-mono version of the album \"Past Masters\".  \"Mono Masters\" was originally a two-CD set included as part of \"The Beatles in Mono\" box set.  The premise of this box set was to compile only Beatles material which was released or prepared for release with a dedicated mono mix (the set excludes later material mixed and released only in stereo, and material whose mono version was simply created as an equal mix of the two channels of the stereo version).  As a result, the track listing for \"Mono Masters\" differs from \"Past Masters\" on the second half of disc two, omitting some later songs that never had a mono mix (\"Old Brown Shoe\", \"The Ballad of John and Yoko\" and \"Let It Be\"), and adding several songs released on stereo-only albums that had unreleased mono mixes.  Tracks 9\u201312 and 15 were prepared in March 1969 for release as a 7\" mono \"Yellow Submarine\" EP, two months after the release of the similarly titled soundtrack album, but the project was scrapped, although the EP was mastered.  Subsequently, the tracks were only released in stereo (and in an electronically produced mono mixdown, or \"fold-down\", of the stereo mix), while the true mono mixes remained unreleased.",

Dr. Martin Luther King Drive in the Douglas community area of Chicago, Illinois.  Built in 1921, the building served as the headquarters of the Supreme Life Insurance Company, which was founded two years earlier.  The company, originally known as the Liberty Life Insurance Company, was the first African-American owned insurance company in the northern United States.  Since white-owned insurance firms regularly denied black customers life insurance when the firm was founded, the firm played an important role in providing life insurance to Chicago's African-American community.

Subsequently, the tracks were only released in stereo (and in an electronically produced mono mixdown, or \"fold-down\", of the stereo mix), while the true mono mixes remained unreleased.  \"Get Back\" (with B-side \"Don't Let Me Down\") was the final Beatles single mixed for mono format.  It was released in the UK in mono, though the US release was in stereo.

Their recording spent three weeks at No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 singles chart in 1958, while reaching No. 2 on UK's \"New Musical Express\" chart.  Peter & Gordon and Bobby Vinton later had hits with the song, with its title and lyrics changed to \"To Know You Is to Love You\".

The box set was originally planned to be released in October 2007, but was delayed due to a problem with the vinyl, as well as other problems in the production of the box set.  The delay ran until February 2008.  Reasons for the delay included faulty test pressings, inferiority of the L.A.

According to Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine, it is \"\"the first comprehensive, multi-label Waylon Jennings retrospective ever assembled\", comprising ninety-two songs recorded between 1958 and 1994, with selections from the majority of the singer's recording career.  The first track of the box set is the Buddy Holly-produced \"Jole Blon,\" released in 1958, while the last is \"I Do Believe,\" a song produced by Don Was that was included on The Highwaymen's 1995 release, \"The Road Goes on Forever\".  The other material on the box set covers Jennings' career chronologically, with songs ranging from his years on RCA's roster to later compositions from his short-lived stay at Epic Records; it ignores, however, the tracks from Jennings albums released on independent labels.  The majority of the singer's charting singles are included in the package, as are collaborations such as \"Mamas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys\" with Willie Nelson and \"Highwayman\" with The Highwaymen.  A notable addition is the previously unreleased \"The Greatest Cowboy of Them All,\" a 1978 duet with Johnny Cash which was later recorded by Cash alone for \"A Believer Sings the Truth\" (1979) and \"The Mystery of Life\" (1991); two others, \"It's Sure Been Fun\" and \"People in Dallas Got Hair,\" had never been released in the United States.  \"Nashville Rebel\" was released on four CDs, with a 140-page booklet and liner notes by Rich Keinzle and Lenny Kaye.\n\n## Radiohead Box Set\n\nRadiohead Box Set is a box set of the first six studio albums and one live album by the English rock band Radiohead, released on 10 December 2007.

The box set peaked at #95 in Canada's album charts.\n\n## Mono Masters\n\nMono Masters is a compilation album by the Beatles, and is an alternate, all-mono version of the album \"Past Masters\".  \"Mono Masters\" was originally a two-CD set included as part of \"The Beatles in Mono\" box set.  The premise of this box set was to compile only Beatles material which was released or prepared for release with a dedicated mono mix (the set excludes later material mixed and released only in stereo, and material whose mono version was simply created as an equal mix of the two channels of the stereo version).  As a result, the track listing for \"Mono Masters\" differs from \"Past Masters\" on the second half of disc two, omitting some later songs that never had a mono mix (\"Old Brown Shoe\", \"The Ballad of John and Yoko\" and \"Let It Be\"), and adding several songs released on stereo-only albums that had unreleased mono mixes.

This box set is similar to the earlier \"Pebbles Box\" (a 5-LP box set) and includes almost all of the same recordings in that box set (and in the same order), along with numerous bonus tracks at the end of each disc.  Supposedly, \"the Trash Box\" collects the first five volumes of the CDs in the Pebbles series (i.e., those released by AIP Records, not to be confused with the 4 earlier CDs that were issued by ESD Records).  However, as is generally true of the CD reissues of these five volumes (though not nearly to the same extent), the tracks differ significantly on all five discs as compared to both the original Pebbles LPs and the later Pebbles CDs in the corresponding volumes; and the surf rock rarities on \"Pebbles, Volume 4\" have been eschewed entirely.  Overall, there are 109 tracks in the box set (excluding the introduction and ending cuts) as compared to 101 songs on the individual CDs and 72 tracks in the \"Pebbles Box\".  Although most of the recordings on \"the Trash Box\" were released at some point on one of the individual Pebbles albums, several of the songs have not appeared elsewhere in the Pebbles series.  Inexplicably, one of these songs is the well-known hit \"I Fought the Law (but the Law Won)\" by the Bobby Fuller Four (on Disc Four) \u2013 which is also included in the \"Pebbles Box\" \u2013 in place of the much rarer \"Wine Wine Wine\" by Bobby Fuller that appears on \"Pebbles, Volume 2\".\n\n## Chrome, Smoke &amp; BBQ\n\nChrome, Smoke & BBQ is a box set by American blues-rock band ZZ Top, released in 2003.  At the time of release, this box set was notable for using the original mixes for all of the tracks from the band's first five albums for the first time on the CD format.  This box set, and the companion release \"Rancho Texicano\", were the only two CD releases which featured original mixes from \"ZZ Top's First Album\", \"Rio Grande Mud\", and \"Tejas\", aside from 1977's \"The Best of ZZ Top\" which features two tracks from \"Rio Grande Mud\" and one track from \"First Album\". \" Tres Hombres\" and \"Fandango! \" were reissued in their original mixes in 2006, and in 2013, Warner Brothers released the CD box set 'The Complete Studio Albums 1970-1990' which includes the first ten ZZ Top studio albums, all with the original mixes.\n\n## Back to Mono (1958\u20131969)\n\nBack to Mono (1958\u20131969) is a box set (4 compact discs or 5 vinyl LPs) compilation of the recorded work of record producer Phil Spector, through the 1960s, released in 1991 by ABKCO as #7118-2.  The first track, \"To Know Him Is to Love Him,\" released in 1958, features Spector performing as part of the group the Teddy Bears.  Initially a vinyl album-sized package, the box contained a booklet with photographs, complete song lyrics, discographical information, and a reproduction of the essay on Spector by Tom Wolfe, \"The First Tycoon of Teen.\"  The package also contained a small, round, red \"Back to Mono\" pin.\n\n## Live in Japan (John Coltrane album)\n\nLive in Japan is a four-disc box set by American saxophonist John Coltrane and his last group, featuring the quintet of Coltrane, his wife/pianist Alice, saxophonist/bass clarinetist Pharoah Sanders, bassist Jimmy Garrison and drummer Rashied Ali.  The 4-CD set compiles all the music issued as three albums in the seventies by Impulse! ; \"Concert In Japan\" (1973, US 2-LP, electronically processed for compatible quadrophonic/stereo), \"Coltrane In Japan\" (1974, Japan 3-LP (side six is blank), mono) and \"Second Night In Tokyo\" (1976, Japan 3-LP (side six contains an interview, mono).

It was used for a short period as an Aircraft Warning Service station during World War II, watching for Japanese airplanes.  It did not reopen until 1953, after the National Park Service had purchased the Olympic Recreation Company's holdings in 1951, having purchased the Chalet itself in 1939.  After a period of neglect, the chalet was restored in 1983-84.  It was one of four such accommodations built by the Olympic Recreation Company and the Olympic Chalet Company; Low Divide Chalet, Nine Mile Shelter, Graves Creek Inn and the Enchanted Valley Chalet.  Of the four, only the Enchanted Valley Chalet and the bathhouse at Low Divide remain.\n\n## Moonstone, Ontario\n\nMoonstone, Ontario (part of Oro-Medonte township) is a small and tight-knit community nestled in the Northern stretch of Ontario's Simcoe County.

Land art includes everything from constructing a road, to taking a walk, building a monument, and leaving a mark in the sand.  The program seeks to expand upon connections between typically separate fields.  Each fall we spend two months camping while traveling 7,000 miles to engage sites that range from the CLUI complex at Wendover, Utah to the pottery culture at Mata Ortiz, Mexico, from earth works like Robert Smithson's Spiral Jetty to archeological sites like Chaco Canyon.  We learn from the fact that Donald Judd surrounded himself with both contemporary sculpture and Navajo rugs; that Chaco Canyon and Roden Crater function as celestial instruments; and that the Very Large Array is a scientific research center with a powerful aesthetic presence on the land.  We spend the semester living and working in the landscape with guest scholars that expand the range of our definition in disciplines including archeology, art history, architecture, ceramics, criticism, writing, design, and studio art.  The immersive nature of how we experience the landscape triggers an amalgamated body of inquiry where students have the opportunity of time and space to develop authority in their work through direct action and reflection.  Land Arts hinges on the primacy of first person experience and the realization that human-land relationships are rarely singular.",

The concept of weighing a heart against Maat (the feather of truth) was a part of the ancient Egyptian belief system, but it was used in the context of determining the moral character and worthiness of the deceased for entry into the afterlife, not as a means to punish them with damnation or torment in the lake of fire. The idea of such a punishment is more related to Christian beliefs, where believers face judgement on a last day to determine if they will spend eternity in Gehenna or heaven for their sin.",

Their often violent conflict ends with Horus's triumph, which restores order to Egypt after Set's unrighteous reign and completes the process of Osiris's resurrection.  The myth, with its complex symbolism, is integral to the Egyptian conceptions of kingship and succession, conflict between order and disorder, and especially death and the afterlife.  It also expresses the essential character of each of the four deities at its center, and many elements of their worship in ancient Egyptian religion were derived from the myth.\n\n## Ancient Egyptian offering formula\n\nThe Ancient Egyptian offering formula, generally referred to as the \u1e25tp-d\u1ec9-nsw formula by Egyptologists, was written as an offering for the deceased in the ancient Egyptian religion.  The offering formula was believed to allow the deceased to partake in offerings presented to the major deities in the name of the king, or in offerings presented directly to the deceased by family members.  All ancient Egyptian offering formulas share the same basic structure, but there is a great deal of variety in which deities and offerings are mentioned, and which epithets and titles are used.  Below is an example of a typical offering formula:\n\n## Pyramid Texts\n\nThe Pyramid Texts are a collection of ancient Egyptian religious texts from the time of the Old Kingdom.  Written in Old Egyptian, the pyramid texts were carved on the walls and sarcophagi of the pyramids at Saqqara during the 5th and 6th Dynasties of the Old Kingdom.  The oldest of the texts have been dated to between ca. 2400\u20132300 BC.  Unlike the later Coffin Texts and Book of the Dead, the pyramid texts were reserved only for the pharaoh and were not illustrated.  Following the earlier Palermo Stone, the pyramid texts mark the next-oldest known mention of Osiris, who would become the most important deity associated with afterlife in the Ancient Egyptian religion.\n\n## Damnation\n\nDamnation (from Latin \"damnatis\") is the concept of divine punishment and torment in an afterlife for actions that were committed on Earth.  In Ancient Egyptian religious tradition, citizens would recite the 42 negative confessions of Maat as their heart was weighed against the feather of truth.  If the citizen's heart was heavier than a feather they would face torment in a lake of fire.  Zoroastrianism developed an eschatological concept of a Last Judgment called Frashokereti where the dead will be raised and the righteous wade though a river of milk while the wicked will be burned in a river of molten metal.  Abrahamic religions such as Christianity have similar concepts of believers facing judgement on a last day to determine if they will spend eternity in Gehenna or heaven for their sin .  A damned human \"in damnation\" is said to be either in Hell, or living in a state wherein they are divorced from Heaven and/or in a state of disgrace from God's favor.  In traditional Abrahamic demonology, the Devil rules Hell, where he and his demons punish the damned.\n\n## Traditional Berber religion\n\nThe traditional Berber religion is the ancient and native set of beliefs and deities adhered to by the Berber autochthones of North Africa.  Many ancient Berber beliefs were developed locally whereas others were influenced over time through contact with other traditional African religions (such as the Ancient Egyptian religion), or borrowed during antiquity from the Punic religion, Judaism, Iberian mythology, and the Hellenistic religion.  The most recent influence came from Islam and pre-Islamic Arab religion during the medieval period.  Some of the ancient Berber beliefs still exist today subtly within the Berber popular culture and tradition.\n\n## Ancient Egyptian deities\n\nAncient Egyptian deities are the gods and goddesses worshipped in ancient Egypt.  The beliefs and rituals surrounding these gods formed the core of ancient Egyptian religion, which emerged sometime in prehistory.  Deities represented natural forces and phenomena, and the Egyptians supported and appeased them through offerings and rituals so that these forces would continue to function according to \"maat\", or divine order.  After the founding of the Egyptian state around 3100\u00a0BC, the authority to perform these tasks was controlled by the pharaoh, who claimed to be the gods' representative and managed the temples where the rituals were carried out.",

It centered on the Egyptians' interaction with many deities who were believed to be present in, and in control of, the forces of nature.  Rituals such as prayers and offerings were efforts to provide for the gods and gain their favor.  Formal religious practice centered on the pharaoh, the king of Egypt, who was believed to possess a divine power by virtue of his position.  He acted as the intermediary between his people and the gods and was obligated to sustain the gods through rituals and offerings so that they could maintain order in the universe.  The state dedicated enormous resources to Egyptian rituals and to the construction of the temples.\n\n## Hatmehit\n\nHatmehit, or Hatmehyt (reconstructed to have been pronounced *H\u0101wit-Ma\u1e25\u016byat in Egyptian) in the ancient Egyptian religion was a fish-goddess in the area around the delta city of Per-banebdjedet, Mendes.  In ancient Egyptian art Hatmehit was depicted either as a fish, or a woman with a fish emblem or crown on her head.  She was a goddess of life and protection.\n\n## Ra\n\nRa ( ; Egyptian: \"r\ua725\" or \"r\u02e4;\" also transliterated \"r\u02e4w;\" cuneiform: \ud808\ude91\ud808\udc00 \"ri-a\" or \ud808\ude91\ud808\udd40 \"ri-ia\") or Re ( ; <a href=\"Coptic%20language\">Coptic</a>: , \"R\u0113\") is the <a href=\"ancient%20Egyptian%20religion\">ancient Egyptian</a> <a href=\"sun%20god\">sun god</a>.  By the Fifth Dynasty in the 25th and 24th\u00a0centuries\u00a0, he had become a major god in ancient Egyptian religion, identified primarily with the noon sun.\n\n## Neo Geo Cup '98: The Road to the Victory\n\nNeo Geo Cup '98: The Road to the Victory is a soccer video game based on the FIFA World Cup 1998, despite being released after the 1998 FIFA World Cup.  It features 73 teams' countries.  Each team enters a \"Regional Qualifying Round Final\" where it plays a team it actually played in the 1998 FIFA World Cup qualification.  For example: Spain would face Yugoslavia, an opponent it actually faced in its qualifying group.  Or Italy would face Russia, an opponent Italy faced in the UEFA play-offs.  If the player beats the opponent, it goes to a group much like the real life World Cup.  In fact, the team faces opponents that were actually in its group.  For example: Mexico would face the Netherlands, Belgium and South Korea.  It is a re-make of \"Super Sidekicks 3\".  However, animations and designs were exactly the same.  The only difference is teams to reflect the World Cup, kits again to reflect the World Cup, and players to resemble squads from the World Cup (teams that did not qualify use line-ups from friendly games and qualifiers).  Its slogan is \"We got the kick\".\n\n## Osiris myth\n\nThe Osiris myth is the most elaborate and influential story in ancient Egyptian mythology.  It concerns the murder of the god Osiris, a primeval king of Egypt, and its consequences.  Osiris's murderer, his brother Set, usurps his throne.  Meanwhile, Osiris's wife Isis restores her husband's body, allowing him to posthumously conceive a son with her.  The remainder of the story focuses on Horus, the product of the union of Isis and Osiris, who is at first a vulnerable child protected by his mother and then becomes Set's rival for the throne.  Their often violent conflict ends with Horus's triumph, which restores order to Egypt after Set's unrighteous reign and completes the process of Osiris's resurrection.  The myth, with its complex symbolism, is integral to the Egyptian conceptions of kingship and succession, conflict between order and disorder, and especially death and the afterlife.

The test is carried out by submersing the appliance into water with one lead attached to the electrical leads of the appliance, and the other lead connected to the water.  It is often carried out on photovoltaic modules in order to qualify them for IEC61646 or IEC61625 certification.\n\n## Water Resistant mark\n\nWater Resistant is a common mark stamped on the back of wrist watches to indicate how well a watch is sealed against the ingress of water.  It is usually accompanied by an indication of the static test pressure that a sample of newly manufactured watches were exposed to in a leakage test.  The test pressure can be indicated either directly in units of pressure such as bar, atmospheres, or (more commonly) as an equivalent water depth in metres (in the United States sometimes also in feet).\n\n## Draize test\n\nThe Draize Test is an acute toxicity test devised in 1944 by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) toxicologists John H. Draize and Jacob M. Spines.  Initially used for testing cosmetics, the procedure involves applying 0.5mL or 0.5g of a test substance to the eye or skin of a restrained, conscious animal, and then leaving it for set amount of time before rinsing it out and recording its effects.  The animals are observed for up to 14 days for signs of erythema and edema in the skin test, and redness, swelling, discharge, ulceration, hemorrhaging, cloudiness, or blindness in the tested eye.  The test subject is commonly an albino rabbit, though other species are used too, including dogs.  The animals are euthanized after testing if the test renders irreversible damage to the eye or skin.  Animals may be re-used for testing purposes if the product tested causes no permanent damage.  Animals are typically reused after a \"wash out\" period during which all traces of the tested product are allowed to disperse from the test site.\n\n## Electrical safety testing\n\nElectrical safety testing is essential to ensure safe operating standards for any product that uses electricity.  Various governments and agencies have developed stringent requirements for electrical products that are sold world-wide.  In most markets it is mandatory for a product to conform to safety standards promulgated by safety and standard agencies such as UL, CE, VDE, CSA, BSI, CCC and so on.  To conform to such standards, the product must pass safety tests such as the high voltage test (also called as Dielectric voltage-withstand test or high potential test), Insulation Resistance Test, Ground (Earth) Bond & Ground Continuity Test & Leakage Current Test (also called as Line Leakage Test, Earth Leakage Current Test, Enclosure Leakage Current Test or Patient Leakage Current Test).  These tests are described in IEC 60335, IEC 61010 and many other national and international standards.\n\n## Anderson\u2013Darling test\n\nThe Anderson\u2013Darling test is a statistical test of whether a given sample of data is drawn from a given probability distribution.  In its basic form, the test assumes that there are no parameters to be estimated in the distribution being tested, in which case the test and its set of critical values is distribution-free.  However, the test is most often used in contexts where a family of distributions is being tested, in which case the parameters of that family need to be estimated and account must be taken of this in adjusting either the test-statistic or its critical values.  When applied to testing whether a normal distribution adequately describes a set of data, it is one of the most powerful statistical tools for detecting most departures from normality.\n\n## Casio G-Shock Frogman\n\nThe Frogman is a high-end model of the Casio G-Shock line of watches.  It was one of the first models of the \"Master of G\" line, a line of G-Shock watches designed for special uses.  The Frogman has an asymmetric shape and is attached eccentrically on its straps.  It is specially made as a diving watch for scuba divers and is the only ISO 6425-compliant G-Shock line with a 200 m Divers rating.\n\n## Hydrostatic test\n\nA hydrostatic test is a way in which pressure vessels such as pipelines, plumbing, gas cylinders, boilers and fuel tanks can be tested for strength and leaks.  The test involves filling the vessel or pipe system with a liquid, usually water, which may be dyed to aid in visual leak detection, and pressurization of the vessel to the specified test pressure.",

Released several 12\"s and one full length CD on the San Francisco based label Zo\u00ebMagik, and made several compilation appearances, culminating with the sample heavy \"These Waves\" being included on Sasha and Digweed's Northern Exposure mix album.  Apparently impressed by his remixing skills on Geffen Records release The Stone Roses' single \"Begging You\", Scanavino was signed by Geffen in '96 and finished his second full length album in late '97.  The track \"Beyond\" was slated for single release in November '97 (complete with music video created by San Francisco based multimedia studio Mind's Eye Media), and the album, titled \"African Cosmopolitan\", was slated for a January '98 release, however, neither saw the light of day, and YAP was apparently dropped from the label.  The Zo\u00ebMagik-released album was not re-released on Geffen due to unresolved sample clearance issues.\n\n## Hundred Visions\n\nHundred Visions is an American three piece rock band from Austin, Texas, formed in 2010.

The two moved to Athens, Georgia, to attend college in 1996.  There they met Ryan Lewis, co-founder of Kindercore Records, who played drums at the first Masters of the Hemisphere show.  Jeff Griggs (also of The Mendoza Line) soon replaced Lewis.  In 1997 Kindercore released their debut seven-inch ep, \"Going on a Trek to Iceland\".  The group then recorded their first full length album, the eponymous \"Masters of the Hemisphere\", which was released on Kindercore Records in 1998.  The band soon expanded to a four-piece, adding multi-instrumentalist Adrian Finch.  Several singles and compilation appearances followed, including a release on the Happy Happy Birthday To Me Records singles club, before the band released their second full length, the concept album \"I Am Not a Freemdoom\", also on Kindercore.  The record garnered mixed reviews, which in part was likely due to the album's rather complicated concept, regarding an island of reservoir-dwelling creatures being enslaved by an evil dog.  The \"Permanent Stranger\" EP followed in 2002, on the dcBaltimore2012 label.  The band split up after their next album, 2002's well received \"Protest a Dark Anniversary\".  A recording of their then-final show at Athens, Georgia's 40 Watt Club was later released as \"The Last Show Ever\".\n\n## National Socialist black metal\n\nNational Socialist black metal (NSBM), sometimes called Aryan black metal or neo-Nazi black metal, is black metal music that promotes Nazism or similar ideologies.  It typically melds neo-Nazi ideology with ethnic European paganism and opposition to \"foreign\" religions such as Christianity, Islam and Judaism.  However, some artists are Satanists or occultists, rather than pagans.  NSBM is not seen as a distinct genre, but as a neo-v\u00f6lkisch movement within black metal.  According to Mattias Gardell, NSBM musicians see this ideology as \"a logical extension of the political and spiritual dissidence inherent in black metal\".\n\n## L\u00f3rien (band)\n\nL\u00f3rien was an independent rock band that formed in Nashville, Tennessee.  currently they have created one full length album and one EP.",

This is the Wye track that connects the main with the Bruceton side, while rarely used for mainline trains, locals and river jobs use it.  The location is known as 8th Avenue or 8th Avenue Wye.  The main then runs down to Kayne Ave, the central hotbed of all Nashville thru traffic.  The Memphis, Tennessee Ex-L&N Bruceton Subdivision meets with the Terminal.  The Bruceton Sub begins at Church Street at 00N0.0.  The line then runs single track until 00N0.7 \"11th Avenue\" where it turns into double track and also meets the aforementioned, Wye track.  The Bruceton line then goes southwest a while to the next signals, at \"Shops\".  Now speed has been increased.  The line is still double track until \"Sellars\", where speed is increased to 40 and jurisdiction transferred to the SD Dispatcher.  For a short time, 4 main tracks are present and an additional fifth track for switchers and yard movements.  The tracks from left to right in Kayne Ave are as follows: 100, 99, 98, 12, 3.  The Kayne Ave yard is also here in this area, which houses some frieght and some switcher engines.  The tracks to the old shed are covered and removed.  The Union Station is not an active station, but a historic hotel.  Crew change usually occurs at the \"walkway\" which is under the Demombreun St bridge by the Kayne Ave Tower.  This is also where the Ex-NC&StL Chattanooga Subdivision begins.  Then tracks run south to Fogg St/South End where things get complicated.  At milepost 000/0BA/00J187 the 98 track merges into the 12 track, making for 3 tracks now.  There is a crossover from 99 to 12, also a crossover from 12 to 3.  About 2/10ths of a mile down the 99 merges into the 12 track reducing the tracks back to the regular double.  About 4/10ths of a mile down the line from Fogg St, 000187.4, Oak St, is a crossover track from #2 to #1 (the track names are no longer 3 and 12, but are back to regular names).  When trains use this crossover northbound, such as Memphis bound trains from the A-2 line, they refer to it as \"Long Lead\".  And now, the Terminal splits into two parts.  The right side turns into a single track shortly, and will become the Chattanooga Subdivision, and the left side runs south to Brentwood.  The right track runs single shortly until double track for a while.  This begins part of the Chattanooga Sub or J-Line.  The #2 meets with the A-2 connection track at 00J2.2 known as A-2.  Speed is now increased to 40.  Commonly northbounds will stage at 4th Ave on the #1 to await clearance.  Now about a mile down the #1 meets the A-1 connection line.  At 00J3.6 known as A-1.",

In the Middle Ages it was the seat of the bishopric of Ross.  The Cathedral was largely demolished in the mid-seventeenth century by Oliver Cromwell to provide building materials for a citadel at Inverness.  The vaulted south aisle, with bell-tower, and a detached chapter house (used as the tollbooth of Fortrose after the Reformation) remain.  These fragments, though modest in scale, display considerable architectural refinement, and are in the care of Historic Scotland (no entrance charge).

It is the largest firth in Scotland, stretching from Duncansby Head (near John o' Groats) in the north, in the Highland council area, and Fraserburgh in the east, in the Aberdeenshire council area, to Inverness and the Beauly Firth in the west.  Therefore, three council areas have Moray Firth coastline: Highland to the west and north of the Moray Firth and Highland, Moray and Aberdeenshire to the south.  The firth has more than 800 kilometres (about 500 miles) of coastline, much of which is cliff.\n\n## Findlater Castle\n\nFindlater Castle is the old seat of the Earls of Findlater and Seafield, sitting on a 50 ft -high cliff overlooking the Moray Firth on the coast of Banff and Buchan, Aberdeenshire, Scotland.  It lies about 15 km west of Banff, near the village of Sandend, between Cullen and Portsoy.  The cliffs here contain quartz; the name \"Findlater\" is derived not from Norse as earlier stated here, but from the Scots Gaelic words \"fionn\" (\"white\") and \"leitir\" (\"cliff or steep slope\").  The first historical reference to the castle is from 1246.  King Alexander III of Scotland repaired this castle in the 1260s in preparation for an invasion by King Haakon IV of Norway.  The Vikings took and held the castle for some time.  The castle remains that are still there are from the 14th-century rebuilding, when the castle was redesigned based on the Roslyn Castle model.\n\n## Ch\u00e2teau d'Ainay-le-Vieil\n\nCh\u00e2teau d'Ainay-le-Vieil is a 14th century castle built on the grounds of an earlier 12th century castle in Ainay-le-Vieil, Cher, France.  Ch\u00e2teau d'Ainay-le-Vieil is situated at an elevation of 168 meters.  After having bought the castle from Jacques C\u0153ur, Charles de Bigny built a pre-Renaissance Louis XII style chateaux from 1500 to 1505.  The castle has been listed as a \"Monument historique\" since 1968 by the French Ministry of Culture.  The castle, now part of Jacques C\u0153ur's tourist route, has been nicknamed \"the little Carcassonne\" (French: \"le petit Carcassonne\" ) because of its circular shape.  Today the castle is one of the best preserved fortresses of the 14th century.\n\n## Moray Firth fishing disaster\n\nThe Moray Firth fishing disaster of August 1848 was one of the worst fishing disasters in maritime history on the east coast of Scotland, and was caused by a severe storm that struck the Moray Firth.  The event led to widespread improvements to harbours and significant changes to the design of fishing boats over the remainder of the 19th century.\n\n## Roslin Castle\n\nRoslin Castle (sometimes spelt Rosslyn) is a partially ruined castle near the village of Roslin in Midlothian, Scotland.  It is located around 9 miles south of Edinburgh, on the north bank of the North Esk, only a few hundred metres from the famous Rosslyn Chapel.\n\n## Stotfield fishing disaster\n\nThe Stotfield fishing disaster was the first of several fishing disasters of the 19th century on the east coast of Scotland.  A storm struck the Moray Firth on 25 December 1806.  Compared to the Moray Firth fishing disaster of 1848 or the Eyemouth Disaster of 1881, the Stotfield disaster was small.  However, although in those major disasters many more lives and boats were lost, the effect at Stotfield was arguably worse.  There, the village lost its entire fleet of three fishing boats.  More importantly, it lost all of its able bodied men and youths in one afternoon.\n\n## Dover, Kansas\n\nDover is an unincorporated community on the banks of Mission Creek in western Shawnee County, Kansas, United States.

Founded in 1860, it was once a larger community, but it declined for most of the 20th century.  Today a few commercial buildings remain at the intersection of K-4 Highway and 57th Street, but it is mainly a residential area.  A newly founded Dover Community Foundation has been created to support the growth of the community and retention of its history.  Camp Daisy Hindman, a rather large Girl Scout camp, is located 2 miles south of the town.  1\u00bd miles west of town is a 50\u00a0ft high cliff known as Echo Cliff.\n\n## Inverness\n\nInverness ( ; from the Scottish Gaelic: \"Inbhir Nis\" ] , meaning \"Mouth of the River Ness\") is a city in the Scottish Highlands.  It is the administrative centre for the Highland council area, and is regarded as the capital of the Highlands.  Inverness lies near two important battle sites: the 11th-century battle of Bl\u00e0r nam F\u00e8inne against Norway which took place on The Aird and the 18th-century Battle of Culloden which took place on Culloden Moor.  It is the northernmost city in the United Kingdom and lies within the Great Glen (Gleann M\u00f2r) at its north-eastern extremity where the River Ness enters the Moray Firth.  At the latest, a settlement was established by the 6th century with the first royal charter being granted by Dab\u00edd mac Ma\u00edl Choluim (King David I) in the 12th century.  The Gaelic king Mac Bethad Mac Findl\u00e1ich (MacBeth) whose 11th-century killing of King Duncan was immortalised in Shakespeare's largely fictionalized play \"Macbeth\", held a castle within the city where he ruled as Mormaer of Moray and Ross.\n\n## Findochty\n\nFindochty (pronounced ), Scots: \"Finichty\" , Scottish Gaelic: \"Am Fionn Ochdamh\" ) is a village in Moray, Scotland on the shores of the Moray Firth; historically it was part of Banffshire.  The Gaelic name of the village was recorded by Diack using his own transcription method as \"fanna-guchti\", which is of unclear meaning.  One of the earliest references to Findochty is in 1440, when the King granted Findachtifeild to John Dufe, son of John Dufe.  The lands passed from the Duffs to the Ogilvies of Findlater and subsequently, in 1568, the Ord family acquired the manor, port, custom and fishers' lands of Findochty, and later built the House of Findochty, known as Findochty Castle, now a ruin, which stands to the west of the village.  In 1716 the Ords brought 13 men and 4 boys from Fraserburgh under contract to fish from Findochty, and for a time the harbour was busy with landings of herring and white fish.  Findochty expanded as a fishing port through the 1700s and 1800s, and by 1850 was home to 140 fishing boats.  But the expansion in the late 1800s of nearby Buckie provided a better harbour, and some of the fishing fleet had left Findochty by 1890.

Communication basically means sign-mediated interactions following three levels of (syntactic, pragmatic and semantic) rules.  Signs in most cases are chemical molecules (semiochemicals, but also tactile, or as in animals also visual and auditive.  Biocommunication of animals may include vocalizations (as between competing bird species), or pheromone production (as between various species of insects), chemical signals between plants and animals (as in tannin production used by vascular plants to warn away insects), and chemically mediated communication between plants and within plants.  Biocommunication of fungi demonstrates that mycelia communication integrates interspecific sign-mediated interactions between fungal organisms soil bacteria and plant root cells without which plant nutrition could not be organized.\n\n## Psychopsis\n\nPsychopsis, abbreviated Psychp in horticultural trade, is a genus of 5 known species of orchids native to northern South America, Central America and Trinidad.  It was formerly included in the massively paraphyletic \"wastebin genus\" \"Oncidium\".  The genus as a whole is commonly called butterfly orchids, but some species of other orchid genera are also called thus.\n\n## Aubrieta\n\nAubrieta (commonly known as Aubretia) is a genus of about 12 species of flowering plants in the cabbage family Brassicaceae.  The genus is named after Claude Aubriet, a French flower-painter.  It originates from southern Europe east to central Asia but is now a common garden escape throughout Europe.  It is a low, spreading plant, hardy, evergreen and perennial, with small violet, pink or white flowers, and inhabits rocks and banks.  It prefers light, well-drained soil, is tolerant of a wide pH range, and can grow in partial shade or full sun.",

Type III PKSs are associated with the production of chalcones, a class of organic compounds found mainly in plants as natural defense mechanisms and as synthetic intermediates.  CHS was the first type III PKS to be discovered.  It is the first committed enzyme in flavonoid biosynthesis.\n\n## List of poisonous plants\n\nPlants cannot move to escape their predators, so they must have other means of protecting themselves from herbivorous animals.  Some plants have physical defenses such as thorns, spines and prickles, but by far the most common type of protection is chemical.  Over millennia, through the process of natural selection, plants have evolved the means to produce a vast and complicated array of chemical compounds in order to deter herbivores.  Tannin, for example, is a defensive compound that emerged relatively early in the evolutionary history of plants, while more complex molecules such as polyacetylenes are found in younger groups of plants such as the Asterales.  Many of the known plant defense compounds primarily defend against consumption by insects, though other animals, including humans, that consume such plants may also experience negative effects, ranging from mild discomfort to death.\n\n## 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase inhibitor\n\n4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) inhibitors (HPPD inhbitors) are a class of herbicides that prevent plants by blocking 4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase, an enzyme in plants that breaks down the amino acid, tyrosine into components that are used by plants to create other molecules that plants need.  This process of breakdown, or catabolism, and making new molecules from the results, or biosynthesis, is something all living things do.  HPPD inhibitors were first brought to market in 1980, although their mechanism of action was not understood until the late 1990s.  They were originally used primarily in Japan in rice production, but since the late 1990s have been used in Europe and North America for corn, soybeans, and cereals, and since the 2000s have become more important as weeds have become resistant to glyphosate and other herbicides.  Genetically modified crops are under development that include resistance to HPPD inhibitors.  There is a pharmaceutical drug on the market, nitisinone, that was originally under development as an herbicide as a member of this class, and is used to treat an orphan disease, Type I tyrosinemia.\n\n## Stellacyanin\n\nStellacyanin is a member of the blue or type I copper protein family.  This family of copper proteins is generally involved in electron transfer reactions with the Cu center transitioning between the oxidized Cu(II) form and the reduced Cu(I) form.  Stellacyanin is ubiquitous among vascular seed plants.  It is a 20kDa protein whose structure is made up of beta strands forming 2 beta sheets to form a Greek key beta barrel with variable alpha helical structure.  The copper binding domain of the protein is located at the amino-terminal end, while the carboxyl-terminal end is rich in hydroxyproline and serine residues, typical of proteins associated with cell walls of plants.  In addition, it is also heavily glycosylated.  The copper is tetrahedrally coordinated by a cysteine, 2 histidines, and a glutamine residue.  The glutamine residue takes place of a methione ligand typically found in other blue copper proteins.  In addition, electron transfer rates for stellacyanin are faster than for other type I copper proteins suggesting stellacyanin is more solvent accessible at the active site.  The exact function of stellacyanin is unknown.  However, given the fact that type I copper proteins are involved in electron transfer and stellacyanin appears to be associated with the plant cell wall, it is suggested that it is involved in oxidative cross-linking reactions to build polymeric material making up the cell wall.\n\n## Flora of Saskatchewan\n\nThe native flora of the Saskatchewan includes vascular plants, plus additional species of other plants and plant-like organisms such as algae, lichens and other fungi, and mosses.",

Non-native species of plants are recorded as established outside of cultivation in Saskatchewan, of these some non-native species remain beneficial for gardening, and agriculture, where others have become invasive, noxious weeds.  Saskatchewan is committed to protecting species at risk in Canada.  The growing season has been studied and classified into plant hardiness zones depending on length of growing season and climatic conditions.  Biogeographic factors have also been divided into vegetative zones, floristic kingdoms, hardiness zones and ecoregions across Saskatchewan, and natural vegetation varies depending on elevation, moisture, soil type landforms, and weather.  The study of ethnobotany uncovers the interrelation between humans and plants and the various ways people have used plants for economic reasons, food, medicine and technological developments.  The Government of Saskatchewan has declared 3 indigenous plants as provincial symbols.\n\n## Binary cycle\n\nA binary cycle power plant is a type of geothermal power plant that allows cooler geothermal reservoirs to be used than is necessary for dry steam and flash steam plants.  As of 2010, flash steam plants are the most common type of geothermal power generation plants in operation today, which use water at temperatures greater than 182 C that is pumped under high pressure to the generation equipment at the surface.  With binary cycle geothermal power plants, pumps are used to pump hot water from a geothermal well, through a heat exchanger, and the cooled water is returned to the underground reservoir.  A second \"working\" or \"binary\" fluid with a low boiling point, typically a butane or pentane hydrocarbon, is pumped at fairly high pressure (500 psi ) through the heat exchanger, where it is vaporized and then directed through a turbine.  The vapor exiting the turbine is then condensed by cold air radiators or cold water and cycled back through the heat exchanger.\n\n## FuelCell Energy\n\nFuel Cell Energy, Inc. is a global fuel cell power company.  It designs, manufactures, operates and services Direct Fuel Cell power plants (a type of molten carbonate fuel cell), to electrochemically produce electricity and heat from a range of basic fuels including natural gas and biogas.  As the biggest publicly traded fuel cell manufacturer in the U.S., the company operates over 50 plants all over the world.

The team consisted of Husanlal (1910\u20131968) and Bhagatram (1916\u20131973).  They were popular composers in the 1940s and 1950s.  It is said that the concept of a duo of music directors began with them.  Their family name was Batish; their elder brother Amarnath was also a famous composer of film music in 1940s; Shiv Dayal Batish, yet another contemporary, was also related to them.  The brothers trained famous music directors Shankar (of Shankar Jaikishan), Laxmikant (of Laxmikant -Pyarelal) Khayyam and the singer, Mahendra Kapoor.\n\n## Salzburg Festival\n\nThe Salzburg Festival (German: \"Salzburger Festspiele\" ) is a prominent festival of music and drama established in 1920.  It is held each summer (for five weeks starting in late July) within the Austrian town of Salzburg, the birthplace of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.  One highlight is the annual performance of the play \"Jedermann\" (\"Everyman\") by Hugo von Hofmannsthal.\n\n## Lilian Sukis\n\nLilian Sukis (born 29 June 1939, Kaunas) is a Canadian operatic soprano of Lithuanian birth.  After earning diplomas from the University of Toronto and McMaster University, she made her professional opera debut in 1964 as Kate Pinkerton in Giacomo Puccini's \"Madama Butterfly\" with the Canadian Opera Company.  In 1965 she sang the role of Countess Almaviva in Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's \"The Marriage of Figaro\" at the Stratford Festival.  That same year she became a pupil at the Metropolitan Opera Studio and School.
