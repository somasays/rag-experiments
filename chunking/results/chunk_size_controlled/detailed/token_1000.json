The test involves filling the vessel or pipe system with a liquid, usually water, which may be dyed to aid in visual leak detection, and pressurization of the vessel to the specified test pressure.  Pressure tightness can be tested by shutting off the supply valve and observing whether there is a pressure loss.  The location of a leak can be visually identified more easily if the water contains a colorant.  Strength is usually tested by measuring permanent deformation of the container.
