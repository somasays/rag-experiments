The test is carried out by submersing the appliance into water with one lead attached to the electrical leads of the appliance, and the other lead connected to the water.

It is usually accompanied by an indication of the static test pressure that a sample of newly manufactured watches were exposed to in a leakage test.  The test pressure can be indicated either directly in units of pressure such as bar, atmospheres, or (more commonly) as an equivalent water depth in metres (in the United States sometimes also in feet).\n\n## Draize test\n\nThe Draize Test is an acute toxicity test devised",
