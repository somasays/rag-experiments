However, the list of Amanita species suggests that it could potentially contain more species than both Greyia and Calibanus combined due to having over 500 named species. But this comparison cannot be definitive without knowing the exact number of species in each genus from the given context.",

The APG III classification system places it in the family Asparagaceae, subfamily Nolinoideae (formerly the family Ruscaceae. )  It was formerly included in the Agavaceae (now Agavoideae) but is now separated from them, for it is polycarpic and dioecious.

The genus contains 27 known currently living species and one or two fossil species.  Most species are endemic to mountainous areas of Mexico, while few species extend into the mountains of Guatemala, Honduras and Belize.
