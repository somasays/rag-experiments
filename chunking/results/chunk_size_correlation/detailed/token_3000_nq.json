Currently the Ahmed Hamdi is the only tunnel connecting Suez to the Sinai . Alternative routes ( edit ) Cape Agulhas ( edit ) A graphical comparison between the Northern Sea Route ( blue ) and an alternative route through Suez Canal ( red ) The main alternative is around Cape Agulhas , the southernmost point of Africa , commonly referred as the Cape of Good Hope route . This was the only sea route before the canal was constructed , and when the canal was closed . It is still the only route for ships that are too large for the canal . In the early 21st century , the Suez Canal has suffered from diminished traffic due to piracy in Somalia , with many shipping companies choosing to take the long route instead . Between 2008 and 2010 , it is estimated that the canal lost 10 % of traffic due to the threat of piracy , and another 10 % due to the financial crisis . An oil tanker going from Saudi Arabia to the United States has 2,700 mi ( 4,345 km ) longer to go when taking the route south of Africa rather than the canal . Before the canal 's opening in 1869 , goods were sometimes offloaded from ships and carried overland between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea .

Constructed by the Suez Canal Company between 1859 and 1869 , it was officially opened on November 17 , 1869 . The canal offers watercraft a shorter journey between the North Atlantic and northern Indian Oceans via the Mediterranean and Red seas by avoiding the South Atlantic and southern Indian oceans , in turn reducing the journey by approximately 7,000 kilometres ( 4,300 mi ) . It extends from the northern terminus of Port Said to the southern terminus of Port Tewfik at the city of Suez . Its length is 193.30 km ( 120.11 mi ) , including its northern and southern access channels . In 2012 , 17,225 vessels traversed the canal ( 47 per day ) . The original canal was a single - lane waterway with passing locations in the Ballah Bypass and the Great Bitter Lake . It contains no locks system , with seawater flowing freely through it . In general , the canal north of the Bitter Lakes flows north in winter and south in summer . South of the lakes , the current changes with the tide at Suez . The canal is owned and maintained by the Suez Canal Authority ( SCA ) of Egypt . Under the Convention of Constantinople , it may be used `` in time of war as in time of peace , by every vessel of commerce or of war , without distinction of flag '' . In August 2014 , construction was launched to expand and widen the Ballah Bypass for 35 km ( 22 mi ) to speed the canal 's transit time . The expansion was planned to double the capacity of the Suez Canal from 49 to 97 ships a day . At a cost of $ 8.4 billion , this project was funded with interest - bearing investment certificates issued exclusively to Egyptian entities and individuals . The `` New Suez Canal '' , as the expansion was dubbed , was opened with great fanfare in a ceremony on 6 August 2015 . On 24 February 2016 , the Suez Canal Authority officially opened the new side channel . This side channel , located at the northern side of the east extension of the Suez Canal , serves the East Terminal for berthing and unberthing vessels from the terminal . As the East Container Terminal is located on the Canal itself , before the construction of the new side channel it was not possible to berth or unberth vessels at the terminal while the convoy was running .

Berg and Aaron Harberts , who he had worked with on Pushing Daisies , to serve as co-showrunners with him . A month later , Fuller and Kurtzman had asked CBS to delay the series ' release so they could realistically meet the high expectations for the series , and the studio announced that the series premiere had been pushed back to May 2017 . The pair said that `` these extra few months will help us achieve a vision we can all be proud of . '' A few weeks after the delay , Fuller met with Sonequa Martin - Green about portraying the series ' lead , a character that had been surprisingly difficult for the production to cast . Fuller `` felt he found the crucial piece of the puzzle '' , but the actress would not be released from a contract at AMC until her character 's death on The Walking Dead which was not set to air until April 2017 , meaning Discovery would have to be delayed again if Martin - Green was cast . At the end of October , CBS asked Fuller to step down as showrunner . They announced that the production was being restructured to keep Fuller actively involved with the series but not on a day - to - day production level as he shifted his focus fully to American Gods : Berg and Harberts were made sole showrunners , working off of a broad story arc and overall mythology established by Fuller ; Kurtzman and Fuller would continue as executive producers , with Fuller still helping the writers break stories ; and Akiva Goldsman would join the series in a supporting producer role , similar to the role he held on Fringe alongside Kurtzman , to help the showrunners and other producers `` juggle the demands of the series '' . In a statement , CBS reiterated that they were `` extremely happy with ( Fuller 's ) creative direction '' for the series , and were committed to `` seeing this vision through '' . However , some elements of the series that came directly from Fuller were dropped , including some `` more heavily allegorical and complex story '' points and some of his designs . Fuller later confirmed that he was no longer involved in the series at all , which he said was `` bittersweet ... I can only give them the material I 've given them and hope that it is helpful for them . '' By the end of the year , Martin - Green had indeed been cast as the series ' lead , and in May 2017 , the episode order was expanded to 15 . That June , CBS announced a new premiere date of September 24 . Writing ( edit ) `` One of the driving forces of this war was to not vilify either side . The show is often told from both points of view ... there are significant sections of the narrative that are purely from the Klingon point of view and in Klingon . That allows the audience to participate in the debate of who is right and who is wrong . '' -- Executive producer Akiva Goldsman on approaching the Federation - Klingon war from both sides . Fuller wanted to differentiate the series from the previous 700 + episodes of Star Trek by taking advantage of the streaming format of All Access and telling a single story arc across the entire first season . He and the writers had completed this arc by the end of June 2016 .

On November 2 , 2015 , CBS announced a new Star Trek television series to premiere in January 2017 , `` on the heels '' of the original series ' 50th anniversary in 2016 , to be developed specifically for the CBS All Access on demand service . In February 2016 , Bryan Fuller , who began his career writing for the series Star Trek : Deep Space Nine and Star Trek : Voyager , was announced as the new series ' showrunner . Fuller had publicly called for Star Trek to return to television for years , and when he first met with CBS about the series , the company did not have a plan for what the new show would be . He proposed an anthology series with each season being a standalone , serialized show set in a different era , beginning with a prequel to the original series . CBS told Fuller to just start with a single serialized show and see how that performs first , and he began further developing the prequel concept . In June , Fuller announced that the first season would consist of 13 episodes , and a month later , at Star Trek 's 50th anniversary San Diego Comic - Con panel , he revealed the series ' title to be Star Trek : Discovery , and confirmed that it would be set in the `` Prime Timeline '' of the previous Star Trek series . At the end of July , CBS hired David Semel , a veteran television procedural director who was under an overall deal with the studio , to direct the pilot for Discovery . This was a decision that Fuller was not happy with , believing that Semel `` was wrong for the job '' . Fuller wanted a more visionary director , and had personally reached out to Edgar Wright to direct the pilot before CBS hired Semel . As development and pre-production on the series continued , Fuller and Semel `` clashed '' on the direction of the show . The series was also starting to overrun its per - episode budget , while Fuller was attempting to both design new sets , costumes , and aliens as well as heading the series ' writers and also spending considerable time addressing his commitments as showrunner of another new series , American Gods . This caused frustration among CBS executives that were pushing for a January 2017 debut , a date that others believed was unrealistic . By August 2016 , Fuller had hired Gretchen J. Berg and Aaron Harberts , who he had worked with on Pushing Daisies , to serve as co-showrunners with him .

The name Beijing , which means `` Northern Capital '' ( from the Chinese characters \u5317 for north and \u4eac for capital ) , was applied to the city in 1403 during the Ming dynasty to distinguish the city from Nanjing ( the `` Southern Capital '' ) . The English spelling is based on the pinyin romanization of the two characters as they are pronounced in Standard Mandarin . An older English spelling , Peking , is the postal romanization of the same two characters as they are pronounced in Chinese dialects spoken in the southern port towns first visited by European traders and missionaries . Those dialects preserve the Middle Chinese pronunciation of \u4eac as kjaeng , prior to a phonetic shift in the northern dialects to the modern pronunciation . Although Peking is no longer the common name for the city , some of the city 's older locations and facilities , such as Beijing Capital International Airport , with IATA Code PEK , and Peking University , still use the former romanization . The single Chinese character abbreviation for Beijing is \u4eac , which appears on automobile license plates in the city . The official Latin alphabet abbreviation for Beijing is `` BJ '' .

Archaeologists have found neolithic settlements throughout the municipality , including in Wangfujing , located in downtown Beijing . The first walled city in Beijing was Jicheng , the capital city of the state of Ji and was built in 1045 BC . Within modern Beijing , Jicheng was located around the present Guang'anmen area in the south of Xicheng District . This settlement was later conquered by the state of Yan and made its capital . Early Imperial China The Tianning Pagoda , built around 1120 during the Liao dynasty . After the First Emperor unified China , Jicheng became a prefectural capital for the region . During the Three Kingdoms period , it was held by Gongsun Zan and Yuan Shao before falling to Cao Cao 's Wei Kingdom . The AD 3rd - century Western Jin demoted the town , placing the prefectural seat in neighboring Zhuozhou . During the Sixteen Kingdoms period when northern China was conquered and divided by the Wu Hu , Jicheng was briefly the capital of the Xianbei Former Yan Kingdom . After China was reunified during the Sui dynasty , Jicheng , also known as Zhuojun , became the northern terminus of the Grand Canal . Under the Tang dynasty , Jicheng as Youzhou , served as a military frontier command center . During the An - Shi Rebellion and again amidst the turmoil of the late Tang , local military commanders founded their own short - lived Yan dynasties and called the city Yanjing , or the `` Yan Capital . '' Also in the Tang dynasty , the city 's name Jicheng was replaced by Youzhou or Yanjing . In 938 , after the fall of the Tang , the Later Jin ceded the entire northern frontier to the Khitan Liao dynasty , which treated the city as Nanjing , or the `` Southern Capital '' , one of four secondary capitals to complement its `` Supreme Capital '' , Shangjing ( modern Baarin Left Banner in Inner Mongolia ) . Some of the oldest surviving structures in Beijing date to the Liao period , including the Tianning Pagoda . Miaoying Temple and its White Stupa in Dadu which was built by Kublai Khan The Liao fell to the Jurchen Jin dynasty in 1122 , which gave the city to the Song dynasty and then retook it in 1125 during its conquest of northern China . In 1153 , the Jurchen Jin made Beijing their `` Central Capital '' , or Zhongdu . The city was besieged by Genghis Khan 's invading Mongolian army in 1213 and razed to the ground two years later . Two generations later , Kublai Khan ordered the construction of Dadu ( or Daidu to the Mongols , commonly known as Khanbaliq ) , a new capital for his Yuan dynasty to the northeast of the Zhongdu ruins . The construction took from 1264 to 1293 , but greatly enhanced the status of a city on the northern fringe of China proper . The city was centered on the Drum Tower slightly to the north of modern Beijing and stretched from the present - day Chang'an Avenue to the northern part of Line 10 subway . Remnants",

The city , located in northern China , is governed as a direct - controlled municipality under the national government with 16 urban , suburban , and rural districts . Beijing Municipality is surrounded by Hebei Province with the exception of neighboring Tianjin Municipality to the southeast ; together the three divisions form the Jingjinji metropolitan region and the national capital region of China . As a city combining both modern and traditional architecture , Beijing is a megacity rich in history , exemplified in its global influence in politics , economy , education , history , culture , and technology . Beijing is the second largest Chinese city by urban population after Shanghai and is the nation 's political , cultural , and educational center . It is home to the headquarters of most of China 's largest state - owned companies and is a major hub for the national highway , expressway , railway , and high - speed rail networks . The Beijing Capital International Airport has been the second busiest in the world by passenger traffic since 2010 , and , as of 2016 , the city 's subway network is the busiest and second longest in the world , after Shanghai 's subway system . The city 's history dates back three millennia . As the last of the Four Great Ancient Capitals of China , Beijing has been the political center of the country for much of the past eight centuries . With mountains surrounding the inland city on three sides , in addition to the old inner and outer city walls , Beijing was strategically poised and developed to be the residence of the emperor and thus was the perfect location for the imperial capital . Beijing was the largest city in the world by population for much of the second millennium A.D. The city is renowned for its opulent palaces , temples , parks , gardens",

          "full_text": "second largest source of income , after tourism . The history of Hawaii 's economy can be traced through a succession of dominant industries ; sandalwood , whaling , sugarcane , pineapple , the military , tourism and education . Since statehood in 1959 , tourism has been the largest industry , contributing 24.3 % of the gross state product ( GSP ) in 1997 , despite efforts to diversify . The state 's gross output for 2003 was US $47 billion ; per capita income for Hawaii residents in 2014 was US $54,516 . Hawaiian exports include food and clothing . These industries play a small role in the Hawaiian economy , due to the shipping distance to viable markets , such as the West Coast of the contiguous U.S. The state 's food exports include coffee , macadamia nuts , pineapple , livestock , sugarcane and honey . By weight , honey bees may be the state 's most valuable export . According to the Hawaii Agricultural Statistics Service , agricultural sales were US $370.9 million from diversified agriculture , US $100.6 million from pineapple , and US $64.3 million from sugarcane . Hawaii 's relatively consistent climate has attracted the seed industry , which is able to test three generations of crops per year on the islands , compared with one or two on the mainland . Seeds yielded US $264 million in 2012 , supporting 1,400 workers . As of December 2015 , the state 's unemployment rate was 3.2 % . In 2009 , the United States military spent US $12.2 billion in Hawaii , accounting for 18 % of spending in the state for that year . 75,000 United States Department of Defense personnel live in Hawaii . According to a 2013 study by Phoenix Marketing International , Hawaii had the fourth - largest number of millionaires per capita in the United States , with a ratio of 7.2 % . Taxation Hawaii residents pay the most per person in state taxes in the United States . Millions of tourists pay general excise tax and hotel room tax . The Hawaii Tax Foundation considers the state 's tax burden too high , which it says contributes to higher prices and the perception of an unfriendly business climate . State Senator Sam Slom says state taxes are comparatively higher than other states because the state government handles education , health care , and social services that are usually handled at a county or municipal level in most other states . Cost of living The cost of living in Hawaii , specifically Honolulu , is high compared to that of most major U.S. cities , although it is 6.7 % lower than in New York City and 3.6 % lower than in San Francisco . These numbers may not take into account some costs , such as increased travel costs for flights , additional shipping fees , and the loss of promotional participation opportunities for customers outside the contiguous U.S. While some online stores offer free shipping on orders to Hawaii , many merchants exclude Hawaii , Alaska , Puerto Rico and certain other U.S. territories . Hawaiian Electric Industries , a privately owned company , provides 95 % of the state 's population with electricity , mostly from fossil - fuel power stations . Average electricity prices in October 2014 ( 36.41 cents per kilowatt - hour ) were nearly three times the national average ( 12.58 cents per kilowatt - hour ) and 80 % higher than the second - highest state , Connecticut . The median home value in Hawaii in the 2000 U.S. Census was US $272,700 , while the national median",

How would you know if he was going to be the warrior that would protect you at all costs , if he was n't your lover ? '' A 2012 poll by Gallup found that Hawaii had the largest proportion of lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ( LGBT ) adults in the U.S. , at 5.1 % , comprising an estimated adult LGBT population of 53,966 individuals . The number of same - sex couple households in 2010 was 3,239 ; a 35.5 % increase of figures from a decade earlier . In 2013 , Hawaii became the fifteenth U.S. state to legalize same - sex marriage ; a University of Hawaii researcher said the law may boost tourism by $217 million . Economy See also : Hawaii locations by per capita income Post-annexation , Hawaii 's economy and demographic changes were shaped mostly by the agricultural sector 's growth . From the end of World War II onwards , depictions and photographs , such as this , of Hawaii as a tropical , leisure paradise encouraged the growth of tourism in Hawaii , which eventually became the largest industry of the islands .

Hawaiian Electric Industries , a privately owned company , provides 95 % of the state 's population with electricity , mostly from fossil - fuel power stations . Average electricity prices in October 2014 ( 36.41 cents per kilowatt - hour ) were nearly three times the national average ( 12.58 cents per kilowatt - hour ) and 80 % higher than the second - highest state , Connecticut . The median home value in Hawaii in the 2000 U.S. Census was US $272,700 , while the national median home value was US $119,600 . Hawaii home values were the highest of all states , including California with a median home value of US $211,500 . Research from the National Association of Realtors places the 2010 median sale price of a single family home in Honolulu , Hawaii , at US $607,600 and the U.S. median sales price at US $173,200 . The sale price of single family homes in Hawaii was the highest of any U.S. city in 2010 , just above that of the Silicon Valley area of California ( US $602,000 ) . Hawaii 's very high cost of living is the result of several interwoven factors of the global economy in addition to domestic U.S. government trade policy . Like other regions with desirable weather throughout the year , such as areas of California , Arizona and Florida , Hawaii 's residents can be considered to be subject to a `` Sunshine tax '' . This situation is further exacerbated by the natural factors of geography and world distribution that lead to higher prices for goods due to increased shipping costs , a problem which many island states and territories suffer from as well . The situation is compounded even further by what could possibly be the single largest contributor to the high costs of living in Hawaii , a U.S. trade law known as the Jones Act , or the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 . This trade regulation prohibits any foreign - flagged ships from carrying cargo between two American ports -- a practice known as cabotage . Most consumer goods in the United States are manufactured by outsourced labor in East Asia , then transported by container ships to ports on the U.S. mainland , and Hawaii also receives the same goods . Being located in the central Pacific Ocean , right between major Pacific shipping lanes , it would be very economical to unload Hawaiian - bound goods in Honolulu , before continuing on to the mainland . However , this would effectively make the second leg of the voyage between Hawaii and the mainland a domestic route between two American ports . Because most large cargo ships operate under foreign `` flags of convenience '' such as Liberia , Vanuatu or Papua New Guinea , allowing them to avoid the more stringent , and thus more costly , regulations of developed nations ' ports , the domestic leg of the voyage would be disallowed by the Jones Act . Instead , those cargo ships must proceed directly to the West Coast , where distributors break bulk and transport the Hawaiian - bound , Asian - manufactured goods back across the ocean by U.S. - flagged ships and increasing the length of the voyage by more than 50 % . This highly inefficient system of shipping Hawaii 's consumer cargo comes at a very hefty price for the average Hawaiian citizen , and makes the cost of living in Hawaii much , much higher than it would otherwise be . Hawaiian consumers ultimately bear the expense of transporting goods imposed by the Jones Act . This law makes Hawaii less competitive than West Coast ports as",

Accompanied by the title music , the names of the principal cast and creative staff appear . The sequence concludes after about 90 seconds with the title card and brief opening credits indicating the episode 's writer ( s ) and director . Its composition changes as the story progresses , with new locations replacing those featuring less prominently or not at all . Music Main article : Music of Game of Thrones Ramin Djawadi composed the Game of Thrones score . The music for the series was composed by Ramin Djawadi . The first season 's soundtrack , written in about ten weeks before the show 's premiere , was published by Var\u00e8se Sarabande in June 2011 . Soundtrack albums for subsequent seasons have been released , with tracks by the National , the Hold Steady and Sigur R\u00f3s . Djawadi has composed themes for each of the major houses and also for some of the main characters . The themes may evolve over time , as Daenerys Targaryen 's theme started small and then became more powerful after each season . Her theme started first with a single instrument , a cello , and Djawadi later incorporated more instruments for it . Language Main article : Languages of A Song of Ice and Fire The Westerosi characters of Game of Thrones speak British - accented English , often ( but not consistently ) with the accent of the English region corresponding to the character 's Westerosi region ; Eddard Stark ( Warden of the North ) speaks in actor Sean Bean 's native northern accent , and the southern lord Tywin Lannister speaks with a southern accent , while characters from Dorne speak English with a Spanish accent . Characters foreign to Westeros often have a non-British accent . Although English is the common language of Westeros , the producers charged linguist David J. Peterson with constructing Dothraki and Valyrian languages based on the few words in the novels ; Dothraki and Valyrian dialogue is often subtitled in English . It has been reported that during the series these fictional languages have been heard by more people than the Welsh , Irish , and Scots Gaelic languages combined . Effect on location Game of Thrones is funded by Northern Ireland Screen , a UK government agency financed by Invest NI and the European Regional Development Fund . As of April 2013 , Northern Ireland Screen gave the show \u00a3 9.25 million ( $14.37 million ) ; according to government estimates , this has benefited the Northern Ireland economy by \u00a3 65 million ( $100.95 million ) . Tourism Ireland has a Game of Thrones - themed marketing campaign similar to New Zealand 's Tolkien - related advertising . Invest NI and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board also expect the series to generate tourism revenue . According to Arlene Foster , the series has given Northern Ireland the most non-political publicity in its history . The production of Game of Thrones and other TV series also boosted Northern Ireland 's creative industries , contributing to an estimated 12.4 - percent growth in arts , entertainment and recreation jobs between 2008 and 2013 ( compared with 4.3 percent in the rest of the UK during the same period ) .

Original characters such as Splinter , Shredder , and the Foot Soldiers stayed true to the comics in appearance and alignment only .

It pitted the colonies of British America against those of New France . Both sides were supported by military units from their parent countries of Great Britain and France , as well as by American Indian allies . At the start of the war , the French North American colonies had a population of roughly 60,000 settlers , compared with 2 million in the British North American colonies . The outnumbered French particularly depended on the Indians . The European nations declared war on one another in 1756 following months of localized conflict , escalating the war from a regional affair into an intercontinental conflict . The name French and Indian War is used mainly in the United States . It refers to the two main enemies of the British colonists : the royal French forces and the various American Indian forces allied with them . The British colonists were supported at various times by the Iroquois , Catawba , and Cherokee , and the French colonists were supported by Wabanaki Confederacy members Abenaki and Mi'kmaq , and Algonquin , Lenape , Ojibwa , Ottawa , Shawnee , and Wyandot . British and other European historians use the term the Seven Years ' War , as do English - speaking Canadians . French Canadians call it La guerre de la Conqu\u00eate ( the War of the Conquest ) or ( rarely ) the Fourth Intercolonial War . Fighting took place primarily along the frontiers between New France and the British colonies , from Virginia in the south to Newfoundland in the north . It began with a dispute over control of the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers called the Forks of the Ohio , and the site of the French Fort Duquesne within present - day Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . The dispute erupted into violence in the Battle of Jumonville Glen in May 1754 , during which Virginia militiamen under the command of 22 - year - old George Washington ambushed a French patrol . In 1755 , six colonial governors in North America met with General Edward Braddock , the newly arrived British Army commander , and planned a four - way attack on the French . None succeeded , and the main effort by Braddock proved a disaster ; he lost the Battle of the Monongahela on July 9 , 1755 and died a few days later . British operations failed in the frontier areas of Pennsylvania and New York during 1755 -- 57 due to a combination of poor management , internal divisions , effective Canadian scouts , French regular forces , and Indian warrior allies . In 1755 , the British captured Fort Beaus\u00e9jour on the border separating Nova Scotia from Acadia , and they ordered the expulsion of the Acadians ( 1755 -- 64 ) soon afterwards . Orders for the deportation were given by William Shirley , Commander - in - Chief , North America , without direction from Great Britain . The Acadians were expelled , both those captured in arms and those who had sworn the loyalty oath to His Britannic Majesty . Indians likewise were driven off the land to make way for",

These forces arrived at the fort on April 16 , but Contrec\u0153ur generously allowed Trent 's small company to withdraw . He purchased their construction tools to continue building what became Fort Duquesne . Battle of Jumonville Glen Dinwiddie had ordered Washington to lead a larger force to assist Trent in his work , and Washington learned of Trent 's retreat while he was en route . Mingo sachem Tanaghrisson had promised support to the British , so Washington continued toward Fort Duquesne and met with him . He then learned of a French scouting party in the area , so he combined Tanaghrisson 's force with his own and surprised the Canadians on May 28 in what became known as the Battle of Jumonville Glen . They killed many of the Canadians , including their commanding officer Joseph Coulon de Jumonville , whose head was reportedly split open by Tanaghrisson with a tomahawk . Historian Fred Anderson suggests that Tanaghrisson was acting to gain the support of the British and to regain authority over his own people . They had been inclined to support the French , with whom they had long trading relationships . One of Tanaghrisson 's men told Contrecoeur that Jumonville had been killed by British musket fire . Historians generally consider the Battle of Jumonville Glen as the opening battle of the French and Indian War in North America , and the start of hostilities in the Ohio valley . An engraving depicting the evening council of George Washington at Fort Necessity . Following the battle , Washington pulled back several miles and established Fort Necessity , which the Canadians attacked under the command of Jummonville 's brother at the Battle of Fort Necessity on July 3 . Washington surrendered and negotiated a withdrawal under arms . One of his men reported that the Canadian force was accompanied by Shawnee , Delaware , and Mingo warriors -- just those whom Tanaghrisson was seeking to influence . The earliest authenticated portrait of George Washington shows him wearing his colonel 's uniform of the Virginia Regiment . This portrait was painted in 1772 by Charles Willson Peale . News of the two battles reached England in August . After several months of negotiations , the government of the Duke of Newcastle decided to send an army expedition the following year to dislodge the French . They chose Major General Edward Braddock to lead the expedition . Word of the British military plans leaked to France well before Braddock 's departure for North America . In response , King Louis XV dispatched six regiments to New France under the command of Baron Dieskau in 1755 . The British sent out their fleet in February 1755 , intending to blockade French ports , but the French fleet had already sailed . Admiral Edward Hawke detached a fast squadron to North America in an attempt to intercept them . In a second British action , Admiral Edward Boscawen fired on the French ship Alcide on June 8 , 1755 , capturing her and two troop ships . The British harassed French shipping throughout 1755 , seizing ships and capturing seamen . These actions contributed to the eventual formal declarations of war in spring 1756 .

In exploring how each character deals with his or her own personal defeat , Lee builds a framework to judge whether the characters are heroes or fools . She guides the reader in such judgments , alternating between unabashed adoration and biting irony .

The book went through numerous subsequent printings and became widely available through its inclusion in the Book of the Month Club and editions released by Reader 's Digest Condensed Books . Initial reactions to the novel were varied . The New Yorker declared Lee `` a skilled , unpretentious , and totally ingenuous writer '' , and The Atlantic Monthly 's reviewer rated the book `` pleasant , undemanding reading '' , but found the narrative voice -- `` a six - year - old girl with the prose style of a well - educated adult '' -- to be implausible . Time magazine 's 1960 review of the book states that it `` teaches the reader an astonishing number of useful truths about little girls and about Southern life '' and calls Scout Finch `` the most appealing child since Carson McCullers ' Frankie got left behind at the wedding '' . The Chicago Sunday Tribune noted the even - handed approach to the narration of the novel 's events , writing : `` This is in no way a sociological novel . It underlines no cause ... To Kill a Mockingbird is a novel of strong contemporary national significance . '' Not all reviewers were enthusiastic . Some lamented the use of poor white Southerners , and one - dimensional black victims , and Granville Hicks labeled the book `` melodramatic and contrived '' . When the book was first released , Southern writer Flannery O'Connor commented , `` I think for a child 's book it does all right . It 's interesting that all the folks that are buying it do n't know they 're reading a child 's book . Somebody ought to say what it is . '' Carson McCullers apparently agreed with the Time magazine review , writing to a cousin : `` Well , honey , one thing we know is that she 's been poaching on my literary preserves . '' One year after its publication To Kill a Mockingbird had been translated into ten languages . In the years since , it has sold more than 30 million copies and been translated into more than 40 languages . The novel has never been out of print in hardcover or paperback , and has become part of the standard literature curriculum .

To Kill a Mockingbird First edition cover -- late printing Author Harper Lee Country United States Language English Genre Southern Gothic , Bildungsroman Published July 11 , 1960 Publisher J.B. Lippincott & Co . Pages 281 To Kill a Mockingbird is a novel by Harper Lee published in 1960 . It was immediately successful , winning the Pulitzer Prize , and has become a classic of modern American literature . The plot and characters are loosely based on Lee 's observations of her family , her neighbors and an event that occurred near her hometown of Monroeville , Alabama , in 1936 , when she was 10 years old . The story is told by the six - year - old Jean Louise Finch . The novel is renowned for its warmth and humor , despite dealing with the serious issues of rape and racial inequality . The narrator 's father , Atticus Finch , has served as a moral hero for many readers and as a model of integrity for lawyers . One critic explains the novel 's impact by writing , `` In the twentieth century , To Kill a Mockingbird is probably the most widely read book dealing with race in America , and its protagonist , Atticus Finch , the most enduring fictional image of racial heroism . '' As a Southern Gothic novel and a Bildungsroman , the primary themes of To Kill a Mockingbird involve racial injustice and the destruction of innocence . Scholars have noted that Lee also addresses issues of class , courage , compassion , and gender roles in the American Deep South . The book is widely taught in schools in the United States with lessons that emphasize tolerance and decry prejudice . Despite its themes , To Kill a Mockingbird has been subject to campaigns for removal from public classrooms , often challenged for its use of racial epithets . Reaction to the novel varied widely upon publication . Despite the number of copies sold and its widespread use in education , literary analysis of it is sparse . Author Mary McDonough Murphy , who collected individual impressions of To Kill a Mockingbird by several authors and public figures , calls the book `` an astonishing phenomenon '' . In 2006 , British librarians ranked the book ahead of the Bible as one `` every adult should read before they die '' . It was adapted into an Academy Award - winning film in 1962 by director Robert Mulligan , with a screenplay by Horton Foote . Since 1990 , a play based on the novel has been performed annually in Harper Lee 's hometown . To Kill a Mockingbird was Lee 's only published book until Go Set a Watchman , an earlier draft of To Kill a Mockingbird , was published on July 14 , 2015 . Lee continued to respond to her work 's impact until her death in February 2016 , although she had refused any personal publicity for herself or the novel since 1964 .

The production returned to the venue to close the 2014 season , prior to a UK tour . According to a National Geographic article , the novel is so revered in Monroeville that people quote lines from it like Scripture ; yet Harper Lee herself refused to attend any performances , because `` she abhors anything that trades on the book 's fame '' . To underscore this sentiment , Lee demanded that a book of recipes named Calpurnia 's Cookbook not be published and sold out of the Monroe County Heritage Museum . David Lister in The Independent states that Lee 's refusal to speak to reporters made them desire to interview her all the more , and her silence `` makes Bob Dylan look like a media tart '' . Despite her discouragement , a rising number of tourists made Monroeville their destination , hoping to see Lee 's inspiration for the book , or Lee herself . Local residents call them `` Mockingbird groupies '' , and although Lee was not reclusive , she refused publicity and interviews with an emphatic `` Hell , no ! '' Go set a Watchman Main article : Go Set a Watchman An earlier draft of To Kill a Mockingbird , titled Go Set a Watchman , was controversially released on July 14 , 2015 . This draft , which was completed in 1957 , is set 20 years after the time period depicted in To Kill a Mockingbird but is not a continuation of the narrative . This earlier version of the story follows an adult Scout Finch who travels from New York City to visit her father , Atticus Finch , in Maycomb , Alabama , where she is confronted by the intolerance in her community . The Watchman manuscript was believed to have been lost until Lee 's lawyer Tonja Carter discovered it , but this claim has been widely disputed . Watchman contains early versions of many of the characters from To Kill a Mockingbird . According to Lee 's agent Andrew Nurnberg , Mockingbird was originally intended to be the first book of a trilogy : `` They discussed publishing Mockingbird first , Watchman last , and a shorter connecting novel between the two . '' This assertion has been discredited , however , by rare - books expert James S. Jaffe , who reviewed the pages at the request of Lee 's attorney and found them to be only another draft of To Kill a Mockingbird . Nurnberg 's statement was also contrary to Jonathan Mahler 's description of how Watchman was seen as just the first draft of Mockingbird . Instances where many passages overlap between the two books , in some case word for word , also refutes this assertion .

According to Deeley , he planted a friend of his in the Oscar press area behind the stage to ask Fonda if she had seen The Deer Hunter . Fonda replied she had not seen the film , and to this day she still has not . As the Oscars drew near , the backlash against The Deer Hunter gathered strength . When the limos pulled up to the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion on April 9 , 1979 , they were met by demonstrators , mostly from the Los Angeles chapter of Vietnam Veterans Against the War .

'' De Niro was so anxious that he did not attend the Oscars ceremony . He asked the Academy to sit out the show backstage , but when the Academy refused , De Niro stayed home in New York . Producer Deeley made a deal with fellow producer David Puttnam , whose film Midnight Express was nominated , that each would take $500 to the ceremony so if one of them won , the winner would give the loser the $500 to `` drown his sorrows in style .

Best Editing , Peter Zinner Lead - up to Awards season ( edit ) Film producer and `` old - fashioned mogul '' Allan Carr used his networking abilities to promote The Deer Hunter . `` Exactly how Allan Carr came into The Deer Hunter 's orbit I can no longer remember , '' recalled producer Deeley , `` but the picture became a crusade to him . He nagged , charmed , threw parties , he created word - of - mouth -- everything that could be done in Hollywood to promote a project . Because he had no apparent motive for this promotion , it had an added power and legitimacy and it finally did start to penetrate the minds of the Universal 's sales people that they actually had in their hands something a bit more significant than the usual . '' Deeley added that Carr 's promotion of the film was influential in positioning The Deer Hunter for Oscar nominations . On the Sneak Previews special `` Oscar Preview for 1978 '' , Roger Ebert correctly predicted that The Deer Hunter would win for Best Picture while Gene Siskel predicted that Coming Home would win . However , Ebert incorrectly guessed that Robert De Niro would win for Best Actor for Deer Hunter and Jill Clayburgh would win for Best Actress for An Unmarried Woman while Siskel called the wins for Jon Voight as Best Actor and Jane Fonda as Best Actress , both for Coming Home . Both Ebert and Siskel called the win for Christopher Walken receiving the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor . According to producer Deeley , orchestrated lobbying against The Deer Hunter was led by Warren Beatty , whose own picture Heaven Can Wait had multiple nominations . Beatty also used ex-girlfriends in his campaign : Julie Christie , serving on the jury at the Berlin Film Festival where Deer Hunter was screened , joined the walkout of the film by the Russian jury members . Jane Fonda also criticized The Deer Hunter in public . Deeley suggested that her criticisms partly stemmed from the competition between her film Coming Home vying with The Deer Hunter for Best Picture . According to Deeley , he planted a friend of his in the Oscar press area behind the stage to ask Fonda if she had seen The Deer Hunter . Fonda replied she had not seen the film , and to this day she still has not . As the Oscars drew near , the backlash against The Deer Hunter gathered strength .

Redeker Nominated Legacy ( edit ) The Deer Hunter was one of the first , and most controversial , major theatrical films to be critical of the American involvement in Vietnam following 1975 when the war officially ended . While the film opened the same year as Hal Ashby 's Coming Home , Sidney Furie 's The Boys in Company C , and Ted Post 's Go Tell the Spartans , it was the first film about Vietnam to reach a wide audience and critical acclaim , culminating in the winning of the Oscar for Best Picture . Other films released in later decades that illustrated the ' hellish ' , futile conditions of bloody Vietnam War combat included : Francis Ford Coppola 's Apocalypse Now ( 1979 ) Oliver Stone 's Platoon ( 1986 ) Stanley Kubrick 's Full Metal Jacket ( 1987 ) John Irvin 's Hamburger Hill ( 1987 ) Oliver Stone 's Born on the Fourth of July ( 1989 ) David Thomson wrote in an article titled `` The Deer Hunter : Story of a scene '' that the film changed the way war - time battles were portrayed on film : `` The terror and the blast of firepower changed the war film , even if it only used a revolver . More or less before the late 1970s , the movies had lived by a Second World War code in which battle scenes might be fierce but always rigorously controlled . The Deer Hunter unleashed a new , raw dynamic in combat and action , paving the way for Platoon , Saving Private Ryan and Clint Eastwood 's Iwo Jima films . '' In a 2011 interview with Rotten Tomatoes , actor William Fichtner retrospectively stated that he and his partner were silenced after seeing the film , stating that `` the human experience was just so pointed ; their journeys were so difficult , as life is sometimes . I remember after seeing it , walking down the street -- I actually went with a girl on a date and saw The Deer Hunter , and we left the theater and walked for like an hour and nobody said anything ; we were just kind of stunned about that . '' The deaths of approximately twenty - five people who died playing Russian roulette were reported as having been influenced by scenes in the movie . Honors and recognition ( edit ) In 1996 , The Deer Hunter was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being `` culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant '' . American Film Institute included the film as # 79 in AFI 's 100 Years ... 100 Movies , # 30 in AFI 's 100 Years ... 100 Thrills , and # 53 in AFI 's 100 Years ... 100 Movies (",

Broadcast from 1998 until 2004 , the original run of the show had a total of 94 episodes . Throughout its six - year run , the show received contributions from various producers , writers , and directors , perhaps most significantly from Michael Patrick King . Set and filmed in New York City and based on the 1997 book of the same name by Candace Bushnell , the show follows the lives of a group of four women -- three in their mid-thirties and one in her forties -- who , despite their different natures and ever - changing sex lives , remain inseparable and confide in each other . Starring Sarah Jessica Parker ( as Carrie Bradshaw ) , Kim Cattrall ( as Samantha Jones ) , Kristin Davis ( as Charlotte York ) , and Cynthia Nixon ( as Miranda Hobbes ) , the quirky series had multiple continuing storylines that tackled relevant and modern social issues such as sexuality , safe sex , promiscuity , and femininity , while exploring the difference between friendships and romantic relationships . The deliberate omission of the better part of the early lives of the four women was the writers ' way of exploring social life -- from sex to relationships -- through each of their four very different , individual perspectives . The series received both acclaim and criticism for its subjects and characters , and is credited with helping jump - start HBO . It spawned two feature films , Sex and the City ( 2008 ) and its sequel Sex and the City 2 ( 2010 ) , and a prequel series by The CW , The Carrie Diaries . It also won seven of its 54 Emmy Award nominations , eight of its 24 Golden Globe Award nominations , and three of its 11 Screen Actors Guild Award nominations .

Bushnell has said in several interviews that the Carrie Bradshaw in her columns is her alter ego ; when she wrote the `` Sex and the City '' essays , she used her own name initially , but for privacy reasons , later created the character played in the series by Sarah Jessica Parker . Carrie Bradshaw was a writer living in New York City . Carrie Bradshaw and Candace Bushnell have the same initials , a flourish emphasizing their connection . Moreover , just as Carrie Bradshaw eventually gets her articles for the fictional ' New York Star ' published as a book in later series , the entire Sex and the City series is based on a compilation of Bushnell 's own columns for the ' New York Observer .

Field described the show 's influence as `` like sitting at the bottom of an atom bomb '' . Criticism ( edit ) Criticism has been expressed about the influence the show has on adolescents and how the images displayed on the show affect the way women and young girls view themselves . Unplanned pregnancy was a topic during episode `` The Baby Shower '' ( 1.10 ) when Carrie found herself in a potential unplanned pregnancy situation with Mr. Big ( it was a false alarm ) . In the episode `` Coulda Woulda Shoulda '' ( 4.11 ) , Miranda did find herself dealing with an unplanned pregnancy and potential abortion . Miranda opted against the abortion and throughout season 5 and 6 , we saw how Miranda dealt with raising a child as a single mother . There were also two episodes that dealt with sexually transmitted diseases . In the episode `` Are we Sluts '' ( 3.06 ) , Miranda had to deal with a case of chlamydia along with contacting her former lovers so they could also be tested . In `` Running with Scissors '' ( 3.11 ) , Samantha faced having an HIV test after a partner refused to have sex with her until she gets tested . Tanya Gold of The Daily Telegraph stated , `` Sex and the City is to feminism what sugar is to dental care . The first clue is in the opening credits of the television show . Carrie is standing in a New York street in a ballet skirt , the sort that toddlers wear . She is dressed , unmistakably , as a child . And , because she is sex columnist on a newspaper , a bus wearing a huge photo of her in a tiny dress trundles past . ' Carrie Bradshaw knows good sex , ' says the bus . And there , before any dialogue hits your ears , you have the two woeful female archetypes that Sex and the City loves -- woman as sex object and woman as child ... In another ( episode ) , Carrie realizes she is homeless because she has spent $40,000 on shoes and does not have a deposit for an apartment . ( In this crisis , she cries and borrows the money for the deposit -- what child would do anything else ? ) .

The battles were fought on April 19 , 1775 in Middlesex County , Province of Massachusetts Bay , within the towns of Lexington , Concord , Lincoln , Menotomy ( present - day Arlington ) , and Cambridge . They marked the outbreak of armed conflict between the Kingdom of Great Britain and its thirteen colonies in America . In late 1774 , Colonial leaders adopted the Suffolk Resolves in resistance to the alterations made to the Massachusetts colonial government by the British parliament following the Boston Tea Party . The colonial assembly responded by forming a Patriot provisional government known as the Massachusetts Provincial Congress and calling for local militias to train for possible hostilities . The Colonial government exercised effective control of the colony outside of British - controlled Boston . In response , the British government in February 1775 declared Massachusetts to be in a state of rebellion . About 700 British Army regulars in Boston , under Lieutenant Colonel Francis Smith , were given secret orders to capture and destroy Colonial military supplies reportedly stored by the Massachusetts militia at Concord . Through effective intelligence gathering , Patriot leaders had received word weeks before the expedition that their supplies might be at risk and had moved most of them to other locations .

Each company had its own lieutenant , but the majority of the captains commanding them were volunteers attached to them at the last minute , drawn from all the regiments stationed in Boston . This lack of familiarity between commander and company would cause problems during the battle . The British began to awaken their troops at 9 pm on the night of April 18 and assembled them on the water 's edge on the western end of Boston Common by 10 pm . Colonel Smith was late in arriving , and there was no organized boat - loading operation , resulting in confusion at the staging area . The boats used were naval barges that were packed so tightly that there was no room to sit down . When they disembarked near Phipps Farm in Cambridge , it was into waist - deep water at midnight . After a lengthy halt to unload their gear , the regulars began their 17 miles ( 27 km ) march to Concord at about 2 am . During the wait they were provided with extra ammunition , cold salt pork , and hard sea biscuits . They did not carry knapsacks , since they would not be encamped . They carried their haversacks ( food bags ) , canteens , muskets , and accoutrements , and marched off in wet , muddy shoes and soggy uniforms . As they marched through Menotomy , sounds of the colonial alarms throughout the countryside caused the few officers who were aware of their mission to realize they had lost the element of surprise . At about 3 am , Colonel Smith sent Major Pitcairn ahead with six companies of light infantry under orders to quick march to Concord . At about 4 am Smith made the wise but belated decision to send a messenger back to Boston asking for reinforcements . The Battles Lexington BEP engraved vignette Battle of Lexington which appeared on the $20 National Bank Note Battle of Lexington , April 19 , 1775 , New York Public Library Though often styled a battle , in reality the engagement at Lexington was a minor brush or skirmish . As the regulars ' advance guard under Pitcairn entered Lexington at sunrise on April 19 , 1775 , about 80 Lexington militiamen emerged from Buckman Tavern and stood in ranks on the village common watching them , and between 40 and 100 spectators watched from along the side of the road . Their leader was Captain John Parker , a veteran of the French and Indian War , who was suffering from tuberculosis and was at times difficult to hear . Of the militiamen who lined up , nine had the surname Harrington , seven Munroe ( including the company 's orderly sergeant , William Munroe ) , four Parker , three Tidd , three Locke , and three Reed ; fully one quarter of them were related to Captain Parker in some way . This group of militiamen was part of Lexington 's `` training band '' , a way of organizing local militias dating back to the Puritans , and not what was styled a minuteman company . After having waited most of the night with no sign of any British troops ( and wondering if Paul Revere 's warning was true ) , at about 4 : 15 a.m. , Parker got his confirmation . Thaddeus Bowman , the last scout that Parker had sent out , rode up at a gallop and told him that they were not only coming , but coming in force and they were close . Captain Parker was clearly aware that he was outmatched in the confrontation and was not prepared to sacrifice his men for no purpose . He knew that most of",

'' Politicians in London tended to blame Gage for the conflict instead of their own policies and instructions . The British troops in Boston variously blamed General Gage and Colonel Smith for the failures at Lexington and Concord . The day after the battle , John Adams left his home in Braintree to ride along the battlefields . He became convinced that `` the Die was cast , the Rubicon crossed . '' Thomas Paine in Philadelphia had previously thought of the argument between the colonies and the Home Country as `` a kind of law - suit '' , but after news of the battle reached him , he `` rejected the hardened , sullen - tempered Pharaoh of England forever . '' George Washington received the news at Mount Vernon and wrote to a friend , `` the once - happy and peaceful plains of America are either to be drenched in blood or inhabited by slaves . Sad alternative ! But can a virtuous man hesitate in his choice ? '' A group of hunters on the frontier named their campsite Lexington when they heard news of the battle in June . It eventually became the city of Lexington , Kentucky . Legacy Gravemarkers along Battle Road in Lexington are maintained with Britain 's 1775 version of the Union Flag . It was important to the early American government that an image of British fault and American innocence be maintained for this first battle of the war . The history of Patriot preparations , intelligence , warning signals , and uncertainty about the first shot was rarely discussed in the public sphere for decades . The story of the wounded British soldier at the North Bridge , hors de combat , struck down on the head by a Minuteman using a hatchet , the purported `` scalping '' , was strongly suppressed . Depositions mentioning some of these activities were not published and were returned to the participants ( this notably happened to Paul Revere ) . Paintings portrayed the Lexington fight as an unjustified slaughter . The issue of which side was to blame grew during the early nineteenth century . For example , older participants ' testimony in later life about Lexington and Concord differed greatly from their depositions taken under oath in 1775 . All now said the British fired first at Lexington , whereas fifty or so years before , they were n't sure . All now said they fired back , but in 1775 , they said few were able to . The `` Battle '' took on an almost mythical quality in the American consciousness . Legend became more important than truth . A complete shift occurred , and the Patriots were portrayed as actively fighting for their cause , rather than as suffering innocents . Paintings of the Lexington skirmish began to portray the militia standing and fighting back in defiance . Ralph Waldo Emerson immortalized the events at the North Bridge in his 1837 `` Concord Hymn '' . The `` Concord Hymn '' became important because it commemorated the beginning of the American Revolution , and that for much of the 19th century it was a means by which Americans learned about the Revolution , helping to forge the identity of the nation . After 1860 , several generations of schoolchildren memorized Henry Wadsworth Longfellow 's poem `` Paul Revere 's Ride '' . Historically it is inaccurate ( for example , Paul Revere never made it to Concord )",

In a one - person pottery studio , ceramists or potters produce studio pottery . The word `` ceramics '' comes from the Greek keramikos ( \u03ba\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 ) , meaning `` pottery '' , which in turn comes from keramos ( \u03ba\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 ) meaning `` potter 's clay '' . Most traditional ceramic products were made from clay ( or clay mixed with other materials ) , shaped and subjected to heat , and tableware and decorative ceramics are generally still made this way . In modern ceramic engineering usage , ceramics is the art and science of making objects from inorganic , non-metallic materials by the action of heat . It excludes glass and mosaic made from glass tesserae . There is a long history of ceramic art in almost all developed cultures , and often ceramic objects are all the artistic evidence left from vanished cultures , like that of the Nok in Africa over 2,000 years ago . Cultures especially noted for ceramics include the Chinese , Cretan , Greek , Persian , Mayan , Japanese , and Korean cultures , as well as the modern Western cultures . Elements of ceramic art , upon which different degrees of emphasis have been placed at different times , are the shape of the object , its decoration by painting , carving and other methods , and the glazing found on most ceramics .

Typically the body is first fired in a kiln to convert it into a hard porous bisque . Underglaze decoration may then be applied , followed by glaze , which is fired so it bonds to the body . The glazed porcelain may then be decorated with overglaze painting and fired again to bond the paint with the glaze . Decorations may be applied by brush or by stenciling , transfer printing , lithography and screen printing . Slipware ( edit ) Main article : Slipware Slipware is a type of pottery identified by its primary decorating process where slip is placed onto the leather - hard clay body surface before firing by dipping , painting or splashing . Slip is an aqueous suspension of a clay body , which is a mixture of clays and other minerals such as quartz , feldspar and mica . A coating of white or coloured slip , known as an engobe , can be applied to the article to improve its appearance , to give a smoother surface to a rough body , mask an inferior colour or for decorative effect . Slips or engobes can also be applied by painting techniques , in isolation or in several layers and colours . Sgraffito involves scratching through a layer of coloured slip to reveal a different colour or the base body underneath . Several layers of slip and / or sgraffito can be done while the pot is still in an unfired state . One colour of slip can be fired , before a second is applied , and prior to the scratching or incising decoration . This is particularly useful if the base body is not of the desired colour or texture . Terra sigillata ( edit ) Main article : Terra sigillata In sharp contrast to the archaeological usage , in which the term terra sigillata refers to a whole class of pottery , in contemporary ceramic art , ' terra sigillata ' describes only a watery refined slip used to facilitate the burnishing of raw clay surfaces and used to promote carbon smoke effects , in both primitive low temperature firing techniques and unglazed alternative western - style Raku firing techniques . Terra sigillata is also used as a brushable decorative colourant medium in higher temperature glazed ceramic techniques .

Typically , all stages of manufacture are carried out by the artists themselves . Studio pottery includes functional wares such as tableware , cookware and non-functional wares such as sculpture . Studio potters can be referred to as ceramic artists , ceramists , ceramicists or as an artist who uses clay as a medium . Much studio pottery is tableware or cookware but an increasing number of studio potters produce non-functional or sculptural items .

Earthenware is pottery that has not been fired to vitrification and is thus permeable to water . Many types of pottery have been made from it from the earliest times , and until the 18th century it was the most common type of pottery outside the far East . Earthenware is often made from clay , quartz and feldspar . Terracotta , a type of earthenware , is a clay - based unglazed or glazed ceramic , where the fired body is porous . Its uses include vessels ( notably flower pots ) , water and waste water pipes , bricks , and surface embellishment in building construction . Terracotta has been a common medium for ceramic art ( see below ) . Stoneware is a vitreous or semi-vitreous ceramic made primarily from stoneware clay or non-refractory fire clay . Stoneware is fired at high temperatures . Vitrified or not , it is nonporous ; it may or may not be glazed . One widely recognised definition is from the Combined Nomenclature of the European Communities , a European industry standard states `` Stoneware , which , though dense , impermeable and hard enough to resist scratching by a steel point , differs from porcelain because it is more opaque , and normally only partially vitrified . It may be vitreous or semi-vitreous . It is usually coloured grey or brownish because of impurities in the clay used for its manufacture , and is normally glazed . '' Porcelain is a ceramic material made by heating materials , generally including kaolin , in a kiln to temperatures between 1,200 and 1,400 \u00b0 C ( 2,200 and 2,600 \u00b0 F ) . The toughness , strength and translucence of porcelain , relative to other types of pottery , arises mainly from vitrification and the formation of the mineral mullite within the body at these high temperatures . Properties associated with porcelain include low permeability and elasticity ; considerable strength , hardness , toughness , whiteness , translucency and resonance ; and a high resistance to chemical attack and thermal shock . Porcelain has been described as being `` completely vitrified , hard",

Finally , cigarette vending machines were then banned in public areas of all British pubs , clubs and restaurants , with a fine of \u00a3 2,500 for non-compliance . Famous UK tobacco advertising campaigns have included `` You 're never alone with a Strand '' ( a disastrous campaign which led to Strand Cigarettes being taken off the market ) and `` Happiness is a cigar called Hamlet '' .

Tobacco smoking is still advertised in special magazines , during sporting events , in filling stations and shops , and in more rare cases on television .

United Kingdom ( edit ) The relevant EU directives banning tobacco advertising apply within the United Kingdom , in addition to UK laws restricting tobacco advertising . Surreal Benson & Hedges poster at Victoria Station , London , c. 1978 The first calls to restrict advertising came in 1962 from the Royal College of Physicians , who highlighted the health problems and recommended stricter laws on the sale and advertising of tobacco products . In 1971 , an agreement between the government and the tobacco industry saw the inclusion of health warnings on all cigarette packets . All television commercials for cigarettes were banned on 1 August 1965 , although commercials for loose tobacco and cigars continued until 1991 . Non-television advertising campaigns were still allowed in the UK but came under stricter guidelines in 1986 , which in particular , prevented adverts from actually showing a person smoking . The tobacco producers responded with increasingly indirect and abstract campaigns , among which those of Benson & Hedges and Silk Cut became particularly recognisable . Until about the mid-1990s , many corner shops , newsagents and off licences had on their shop signs prominent branding by cigarette brands such as Benson & Hedges , Silk Cut , Regal etc. until the practice was outlawed .

America 's first regular television news program , Camel News Caravan , was sponsored by Camel Cigarettes and featured an ashtray on the desk in front of the newscaster and the Camel logo behind him . The show ran from 1949 to 1956 . Meanwhile , Phillip Morris sponsored the hit TV show I Love Lucy for the series first five seasons . In June 1967 , the Federal Communications Commission ruled that programs broadcast on a television station that discussed smoking and health were insufficient to offset the effects of paid advertisements that were broadcast for five to ten minutes each day . `` We hold that the fairness doctrine is applicable to such advertisements , '' the Commission said . The FCC decision , upheld by the courts , essentially required television stations to air anti-smoking advertisements at no cost to the organizations providing such advertisements . In April 1970 , President Nixon signed into law the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act banning the advertising of cigarettes on television and radio starting on 2 January 1971 . The Virginia Slims brand was the last commercial shown , with `` a 60 - second revue from flapper to Female Lib '' , shown at 11 : 59 p.m. on 1 January during a break on The Tonight Show . Smokeless tobacco ads , on the other hand , remained on the air until a ban took effect on 28 August 1986 . Even further restrictions took effect under the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act . Effective 22 June 2010 , the new regulations prohibit tobacco companies from sponsoring sports , music , and other cultural events . Also , tobacco companies can no longer display their logos or advertise their products on T - shirts , hats , or other apparel . Eventually , the law is planned to require almost all tobacco advertisements to consist of black text on a white background , but the constitutionality of that requirement has come under scrutiny . After 1971 , most tobacco advertising was done in magazines , newspapers , and on billboards . Since the introduction of the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act , all packaging and advertisements must display a health warning from the Surgeon General . In November 2003 , tobacco companies and magazine publishers agreed to cease the placement of advertisements in school library editions of four magazines with a large group of young readers : Time , People , Sports Illustrated , and Newsweek . A 1994 report by the Surgeon General , `` Preventing Tobacco Use Among Young People , '' asserted : `` When young people no longer want to smoke the epidemic itself will die . '' A critical task of public health was counteracting the `` indoctrination '' of the young when they were most susceptible . Hence the report dismissed as `` misguided '' the debate as to whether cigarette promotion `` caused '' young people to smoke ; the conclusion was that `` Whether causal or not , ( promotion ) fosters the uptake of smoking , initiating for many a dismal and relentless chain of events ''",

Apart from an Anglophile element urging early support for the British , American public opinion reflected that of the president : the sentiment for neutrality was particularly strong among Irish Americans , German Americans and Scandinavian Americans , as well as among church leaders and among women in general . On the other hand , even before World War I had broken out , American opinion had been more negative toward Germany than towards any other country in Europe . Over time , especially after reports of atrocities in Belgium in 1914 and following the sinking of the passenger liner RMS Lusitania in 1915 , the American people increasingly came to see Germany as the aggressor in Europe . As U.S. president , it was Wilson who made the key policy decisions over foreign affairs : while the country was at peace , the domestic economy ran on a laissez - faire basis , with American banks making huge loans to Britain and France -- funds that were in large part used to buy munitions , raw materials , and food from across the Atlantic . Until 1917 , Wilson made minimal preparations for a land war and kept the United States Army on a small peacetime footing , despite increasing demands for enhanced preparedness . He did however expand the United States Navy . In 1917 , with Russia experiencing political upheaval following widespread disillusionment there over the war , and with Britain and France low on credit , Germany appeared to have the upper hand in Europe , while Germany 's ally , the Ottoman Empire , clung stubbornly to its possessions in the Middle East . In the same year , Germany decided to resume unrestricted submarine warfare against any vessel approaching British waters ; this attempt to starve Britain into surrender was balanced against the knowledge that it would almost certainly bring the United States into the war . Germany also made a secret offer to help Mexico regain territories lost in the Mexican -- American War in an encoded telegram known as the Zimmermann Telegram , which was intercepted by British Intelligence . Publication of that communique outraged Americans just as German U-boats started sinking American merchant ships in the North Atlantic . Wilson then asked Congress for `` a war to end all wars '' that would `` make the world safe for democracy '' , and Congress voted to declare war on Germany on April 6 , 1917 . On December 7 , 1917 , the U.S. declared war on Austria - Hungary . U.S. troops began arriving on the Western Front in large numbers in 1918 .

One of these decisions was made in response to British protests that the Germans were using U.S. radio towers to send messages to their warships . Immediately prior to the war starting in 1914 , Britain had cut all cable communications leading out of Germany , including the trans - Atlantic cable . The US Government permitted German embassies to use the US cable lines for `` proper '' diplomatic business . Germany argued that usage of the towers was necessary to allow efficient contact between the U.S. and Germany . Lansing responded by requiring both sides to give the U.S. Navy copies of the messages they sent over the towers . The French and British were still able to use the cables , forcing Germany to be the only belligerent required to provide the U.S. with their messages . This and other seemingly small decisions made by Lansing during this time would eventually stack up , shifting American support towards the Allies . Zimmermann Telegram ( edit ) Main article : Zimmermann Telegram Once Germany had decided on unrestricted submarine warfare in January 1917 , and knowing it would be attacking all American ships in the North Atlantic , it tried to line up new allies , especially Mexico . Arthur Zimmermann , the German foreign minister , sent the Zimmermann Telegram to Mexico on January 16 , 1917 . Zimmerman invited Mexico ( knowing their resentment towards America since the 1848 Mexican Cession ) to join in a war against the United States . Germany promised to pay for Mexico 's costs and to help it recover the territory annexed by the U.S. in 1848 . These territories included the present day states of California , Nevada , Utah , most of Arizona , about half of New Mexico and a quarter of Colorado . British intelligence intercepted and decoded the telegram and passed it to the Wilson administration . The White House would release it to the press on March 1st . Anger grew further as the Germans began sinking American ships , even as isolationists in the Senate launched a filibuster to block legislation for arming American merchant ships to defend themselves . Sinking of American merchant ships ( edit ) In early 1917 Berlin forced the issue . Its declared decision on 31 January 1917 to target neutral shipping in a designated war - zone became the immediate cause of the entry of the United States into the war . Five American merchant ships went down in March . Outraged public opinion now overwhelmingly supported Wilson when he asked Congress for a declaration of war on April 2 , 1917 . Public opinion , moralism , and national interest ( edit ) Historians such as Ernest R. May have approached the process of American entry into the war as a study in how public opinion changed radically in three years ' time . In 1914 most Americans called for neutrality , seeing the war a dreadful mistake and were determined to stay out . By 1917 the same public felt just as strongly that going to war was both necessary and wise . Military leaders had little to say during this debate , and military considerations were seldom raised . The decisive questions dealt with morality and visions of the future . The prevailing attitude was that America possessed a superior moral position as the only great nation devoted to the principles of freedom and democracy . By staying aloof from the squabbles of reactionary empires , it could preserve those ideals -- sooner or later the rest of the world would come to appreciate and adopt them . In 1917 this very long - run program faced the severe danger that in the short run powerful forces adverse to democracy and freedom would triumph .",

We 're finally seeing the full extent of things now after a flashback , why the noose was in that shrine Peter found -- Judith has hallucinated Owen , the entire time . He hanged himself in jail . Peter puts the noose around his neck and steps from the ledge over the shrine , hanging himself as Judith watches , flashing to images of her son slowly dying . But another surprise , as well -- up the river , Dawn is still alive , on shore , and two hunters find her there bleeding profusely . When Keira wakes up she sees Peter hanging . She also finds a letter Peter wrote to Talvinder 's parents , confessing to the crime , trying to give them closure . Admitting that Owen was innocent , they laid the crime on him . Skip ahead a bit : Keira is safe , back home . She meets with Dawn , who 's preparing to turn herself in to the police , to atone for her terrible sins . From a distance , Judith watches them , still followed by the haunting ghost of her son . Neither of them have forgotten Dawn , they 'll wait until she 's free . Development and production ( edit ) Aaron Martin was inspired to write Slasher after his work on the first season of the medical series Saving Hope , including his writing of two Hope episodes where , in his words , `` people got chopped up . '' Martin would write the first episode of Slasher as a spec script , with two intentions for doing so : To offer it to prospective studios , and to show a writing style that was different from his previous work ( e.g. Saving Hope , Degrassi : The Next Generation , Being Erica ) . Though the script did not receive immediate interest , Shaftesbury Films would discover and option it to prospective broadcasters . The script would land at Canadian premium network Super Channel , who , their interest piqued in part by Slasher 's fixed - end format , would order it as a series . The American network Chiller , which specializes in the horror / thriller genre , would join in production sometime after Super Channel ; Slasher would be Chiller 's first foray into original scripted series content . Production on Slasher 's 8 - episode first season was announced on July 28 , 2015 , with filming taking place between then and October 2015 . Three Northern Ontario municipalities -- the cities of Sudbury and Sault Ste . Marie and the town of Parry Sound -- would stand in for the show 's fictitious location , the town of Waterbury . A first trailer for the series would be released on November 26 , 2015 . Unlike most TV series that film their episodes in order , Slasher , under the direction of Craig David Wallace , was shot as if it were a `` super-sized '' movie : Scenes from multiple episodes were shot at the same time , with the availability of locations and cast being factored in . The out - of - order schedule allowed the actors to know of their characters",

Aaron Martin , the series ' creator / producer , acknowledged gaining inspiration for the format from American Horror Story , stating that , should Slasher have subsequent seasons , the AHS style of self - contained storylines would be used along with , ideally , the reliance on as many actors from previous seasons as possible to portray brand new roles . Martin aims to tell `` a modern - day monster story '' in Slasher , combining three of his favorite genres : The contemporary murder mystery ( a la Broadchurch ) , the works of Agatha Christie ( one of Martin 's favorite crime writers ) , and the classic slasher films he grew up with . In terms of the latter , Martin has specifically cited the influences of Halloween and It Follows in Slasher 's use of a mysterious singular embodiment that is responsible for a series of killings . Not wanting to have the show 's killer be `` a mythological creature '' ( as he feels the killers in most slasher films do not have much mystery surrounding them ) , Martin also uses elements of the traditional whodunit in Slasher : The show 's characters , many of whom have mysterious backgrounds -- and their own reasons for possibly being the killer -- are featured , explored , and eliminated from consideration , one by one ( either through death or the natural deductive process ) , until the `` all too human '' killer and their motivations for their actions are revealed . Plot ( edit ) Season 1 : the Executioner ( 2016 ) ( edit ) Slasher 's 8 - episode first season centers around Sarah Bennett who , with husband Dylan , moves back to the town of her birth , Waterbury ( a fictional town in Canada ) , and into her parents ' former home . It was in that house on Halloween Night 1988 where both of her parents , Bryan and Rachel , were murdered . Rachel was pregnant with Sarah at the time of her murder , with police discovering the killer holding Rachel 's newborn baby after the slayings . Sarah 's return to Waterbury is greeted with the start of a series of copycat murders , all appearing to be at the hands of `` The Executioner '' . Seeking insight on her sightings of `` The Executioner '' and the slayings he or she has committed , Sarah has paid visits to her parents ' imprisoned murderer , Tom Winston . Tom suggests to Sarah that though most of Waterbury 's residents project a veneer of friendship , innocence , and self - righteousness , many of them harbor dark secrets , including her late parents . During these conversations , Tom expresses thoughts on what is a common theme of Slasher 's first season -- the seven deadly sins . Gaining information from Sarah on the victims ' backgrounds and the nature of their deaths , Tom provides suggestions as to what sin the victims may have violated ; Sarah would begin to employ this approach herself without Tom 's assistance in later episodes . Just as Tom declared himself `` the Lord 's messenger '' in",

Early years On June 27 , 1954 , the USSR 's Obninsk Nuclear Power Plant became the world 's first nuclear power plant to generate electricity for a power grid , and produced around 5 megawatts of electric power . Later in 1954 , Lewis Strauss , then chairman of the United States Atomic Energy Commission ( U.S. AEC , forerunner of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the United States Department of Energy ) spoke of electricity in the future being `` too cheap to meter '' . Strauss was very likely referring to hydrogen fusion -- which was secretly being developed as part of Project Sherwood at the time -- but Strauss 's statement was interpreted as a promise of very cheap energy from nuclear fission . The U.S. AEC itself had issued far more realistic testimony regarding nuclear fission to the U.S. Congress only months before , projecting that `` costs can be brought down ... ( to ) ... about the same as the cost of electricity from conventional sources ... '' In 1955 the United Nations ' `` First Geneva Conference '' , then the world 's largest gathering of scientists and engineers , met to explore the technology . In 1957 EURATOM was launched alongside the European Economic Community ( the latter is now the European Union ) . The same year also saw the launch of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) . Calder Hall , United Kingdom -- The world 's first commercial nuclear power station . First connected to the national power grid on 27 August 1956 and officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 17 October 1956 The Shippingport Atomic Power Station in Shippingport , Pennsylvania was the first commercial reactor in the United States and was opened in 1957 . The world 's first commercial nuclear power station , Calder Hall at Windscale , England , was opened in 1956 with an initial capacity of 50 MW ( later 200 MW ) . The first commercial nuclear generator to become operational in the United States was the Shippingport Reactor ( Pennsylvania , December 1957 ) . One of the first organizations to develop nuclear power was the U.S. Navy , for the purpose of propelling submarines and aircraft carriers . The first nuclear - powered submarine , USS Nautilus , was put to sea in December 1954 . As of 2016 , the U.S. Navy submarine fleet is made up entirely of nuclear - powered vessels , with 75 submarines in service .

But in 1938 , German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann , along with Austrian physicist Lise Meitner and Meitner 's nephew , Otto Robert Frisch , conducted experiments with the products of neutron - bombarded uranium , as a means of further investigating Fermi 's claims . They determined that the relatively tiny neutron split the nucleus of the massive uranium atoms into two roughly equal pieces , contradicting Fermi . This was an extremely surprising result : all other forms of nuclear decay involved only small changes to the mass of the nucleus , whereas this process -- dubbed `` fission '' as a reference to biology -- involved a complete rupture of the nucleus . Numerous scientists , including Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd , who was one of the first , recognized that if fission reactions released additional neutrons , a self - sustaining nuclear chain reaction could result . Once this was experimentally confirmed and announced by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliot - Curie in 1939 , scientists in many countries ( including the United States , the United Kingdom , France , Germany , and the Soviet Union ) petitioned their governments for support of nuclear fission research , just on the cusp of World War II , for the development of a nuclear weapon . First nuclear reactor In the United States , where Fermi and Szil\u00e1rd had both emigrated , this led to the creation of the first man - made reactor , known as Chicago Pile - 1 , which achieved criticality on December 2 , 1942 . This work became part of the Manhattan Project , a massive secret US government military project to make enriched uranium by building large reactors to breed plutonium for use in the first nuclear weapons . The US tested atom bombs and eventually these weapons were used to attack the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki . The first light bulbs ever lit by electricity generated by nuclear power at EBR - 1 at Argonne National Laboratory - West , December 20 , 1951 . In 1945 , the first widely distributed account of nuclear energy , in the form of the pocketbook The Atomic Age , discussed the peaceful future uses of nuclear energy and depicted a future where fossil fuels would go unused . Nobel laurette Glenn Seaborg , who later chaired the Atomic Energy Commission , is quoted as saying `` there will be nuclear powered earth - to - moon shuttles , nuclear powered artificial hearts , plutonium heated swimming pools for SCUBA divers , and much more '' . The United Kingdom , Canada , and the USSR proceeded to research and develop nuclear industries over the course of the late 1940s and early 1950s .

This includes the Soviet submarine K - 19 reactor accident in 1961 which resulted in 8 deaths and more than 30 other people were over-exposed to radiation . The Soviet submarine K - 27 reactor accident in 1968 resulted in 9 fatalities and 83 other injuries . Moreover , Soviet submarine K - 429 sank twice , but was raised after each incident . Several serious nuclear and radiation accidents have involved nuclear submarine mishaps . The U.S. Army also had a nuclear power program , beginning in 1954 . The SM - 1 Nuclear Power Plant , at Fort Belvoir , Virginia , was the first power reactor in the U.S. to supply electrical energy to a commercial grid ( VEPCO ) , in April 1957 , before Shippingport . The SL - 1 was a U.S. Army experimental nuclear power reactor at the National Reactor Testing Station in eastern Idaho . It underwent a steam explosion and meltdown in January 1961 , which killed its three operators . In the Soviet Union at The Mayak Production Association facility there were a number of accidents , including an explosion , that released 50 -- 100 tonnes of high - level radioactive waste , contaminating a huge territory in the eastern Urals and causing numerous deaths and injuries . The Soviet regime kept this accident secret for about 30 years . The event was eventually rated at 6 on the seven - level INES scale ( third in severity only to the disasters at Chernobyl and Fukushima ) . Development Washington Public Power Supply System Nuclear Power Plants 3 and 5 were never completed . Installed nuclear capacity initially rose relatively quickly , rising from less than 1 gigawatt ( GW ) in 1960 to 100 GW in the late 1970s , and 300 GW in the late 1980s . Since the late 1980s worldwide capacity has risen much more slowly , reaching 366 GW in 2005 . Between around 1970 and 1990 , more than 50 GW of capacity was under construction ( peaking at over 150 GW in the late 1970s and early 1980s ) -- in 2005 , around 25 GW of new capacity was planned . More than two - thirds of all nuclear plants ordered after January 1970 were eventually cancelled . A total of 63 nuclear units were canceled in the USA between 1975 and 1980 . During the 1970s and 1980s rising economic costs ( related to extended construction times largely due to regulatory changes and pressure - group litigation ) and falling fossil fuel prices made nuclear power plants then under construction less attractive . In the 1980s ( U.S. ) and 1990s ( Europe ) , flat load growth and electricity liberalization also made the addition of large new baseload capacity unattractive . The 1973 oil crisis had a significant effect on countries , such as France and Japan , which had relied more heavily on oil for electric generation ( 39 % and 73 % respectively ) to invest in nuclear power .

Ana departed Guam on April 10 and , after two days at Wake Island , found and salvaged the buried coins and precious stones as well as a small quantity of the quicksilver . The wreck of Dashing Wave ( edit ) On July 29 , 1870 , the British tea clipper Dashing Wave , under the command of Captain Henry Vandervord , sailed out of Foochoo , China , en route to Sydney , Australia . On August 31 `` the weather was very thick , and it was blowing a heavy gale from the eastward , attended with violent squalls , and a tremendous sea . '' At 10 : 30 p.m. breakers were seen and the ship struck the reef at Wake Island . Overnight the vessel began to break up and at 10 : 00 a.m. the crew succeeded in launching the longboat over the leeward side . In the chaos of the evacuation , the captain secured a chart and nautical instruments , but no compass . The crew loaded a case of wine , some bread and two buckets , but no drinking water . Since Wake Island appeared to have neither food nor water , the captain and his 12 - man crew quickly departed , crafting a makeshift sail by attaching a blanket to an oar . With no water , each man was allotted a glass of wine per day until a heavy rain shower came on the sixth day . After 31 days of hardship , drifting westward in the longboat , they reached Kosrae ( Strong 's Island ) in the Caroline Islands . Capt . Vandervord attributed the loss of Dashing Wave to the erroneous manner in which Wake Island `` is laid down in the charts . It is very low , and not easily seen even on a clear night . '' American possession ( edit ) With the annexation of Hawaii in 1898 and the seizure of Guam and the Philippines during the Spanish -- American War that same year , the United States began to consider unclaimed and uninhabited Wake Island , located approximately halfway between Honolulu and Manila , as a good location for a telegraph cable station and coaling station for refueling warships of the rapidly expanding United States Navy and passing merchant and passenger steamships . On July 4 , 1898 , United States Army Brigadier General Francis V. Greene of the 2nd Brigade , Philippine Expeditionary Force , of the Eighth Army Corps , stopped at Wake Island and raised the American flag while en route to the Philippines on the steamship liner SS China .

Wake 's defenders sank two Japanese destroyers and one submarine and shot down 24 Japanese aircraft . The relief fleet , en route , on hearing of the island 's loss , turned back . In the aftermath of the battle , most of the captured civilians and military personnel were sent to POW camps in Asia , though some of the civilian laborers were enslaved by the Japanese and tasked with improving the island 's defenses . Japanese occupation and surrender ( edit ) The formal surrender of the Japanese garrison on Wake Island , September 7 , 1945 . Island commander Adm. Shigematsu Sakaibara is the Japanese officer in the right - foreground . The island 's Japanese garrison was composed of the IJN 65th Guard Unit ( 2,000 men ) , Japan Navy Capt . Shigematsu Sakaibara and the IJA units which became 13th Independent Mixed Regiment ( 1,939 men ) under command of Col. Shigeji Chikamori . The Japanese - occupied island ( called by them \u014ctorishima ( \u5927 \u9ce5\u5cf6 ) or Big Bird Island for its birdlike shape ) was bombed several times by American aircraft ; one of these raids was the first mission for future United States President George H.W. Bush . U.S. Civilian POWs Memorial After a successful American air raid on October 5 , 1943 , Sakaibara ordered the execution of all of the 98 captured Americans who remained on the island . They were taken to the northern end of the island , blindfolded and machine - gunned . One prisoner escaped , carving the message `` 98 US PW 5 - 10 - 43 '' on a large coral rock near where the victims had been hastily buried in a mass grave . This unknown American was soon recaptured and beheaded . Sakaibara and his subordinate , Lt. Cmdr . Tachibana , were later sentenced to death after conviction for this and other war crimes . Tachibana 's sentence was later commuted to life in prison . Sakaibara was executed on June 18 , 1947 , on Guam . The remains of the murdered civilians were exhumed and reburied at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in section G . On September 4 , 1945 , the Japanese garrison surrendered to a detachment of United States Marines under the command of Brig. Gen. Lawson H.M. Sanderson . Post-world War II military and commercial airfield ( edit ) The original Drifter 's Reef bar , built near the harbor area at Wake Island , opened its doors to aircrews , visitors and other `` drifters '' on November 8 , 1949 . With the end of hostilities with Japan and the increase in international air travel driven in part by wartime advances in aeronautics , Wake Island became a critical mid-Pacific base for the servicing and refueling of military and commercial aircraft . The United States Navy resumed control of the island , and in October 1945 400 Seabees from the 85th Naval Construction Battalion arrived at Wake to clear the island of the effects of the war and to build basic facilities for a Naval Air Base .",

Although the proposed route for the submarine cable would be shorter by 137 miles , Midway and not Wake Island was chosen as the location for the telegraph cable station between Honolulu and Guam . Rear Admiral Royal Bird Bradford , chief of the U.S. Navy 's Bureau of Equipment , stated before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce on January 17 , 1902 , that `` Wake Island seems at times to be swept by the sea . It is only a few feet above the level of the ocean , and if a cable station were established there very expensive works would be required ; besides it has no harbor , while the Midway Islands are perfectly habitable and have a fair harbor for vessels of eighteen feet draught . '' On June 23 , 1902 , USAT Buford , commanded by Captain Alfred Croskey and bound for Manila , spotted a ship 's boat on the beach as it passed closely by Wake Island . Soon thereafter the boat was launched by Japanese on the island and sailed out to meet the transport . The Japanese told Captain Croskey that they had been put on the island by a schooner from Yokohama in Japan and that they were gathering guano and drying fish . The captain suspected that they were also engaged in pearl hunting . The Japanese revealed that one of their parties needed medical attention and the captain determined from their descriptions of the symptoms that the illness was most likely beriberi . They informed Captain Croskey that they did not need any provisions or water and that they were expecting the Japanese schooner to return in a month or so . The Japanese declined an offer to be taken on the transport to Manila and were given some medical supplies for the sick man , some tobacco and a few incidentals . After USAT Buford reached Manila , Captain Croskey reported on the presence of Japanese at Wake Island . He also learned that USAT Sheridan had a similar encounter at Wake with the Japanese . The incident was brought to the attention of Assistant Secretary of the Navy Charles Darling , who at once informed the State Department and suggested that an explanation from the Japanese Government was needed . In August 1902 Japanese Minister Takahira Kogor\u014d provided a diplomatic note stating that the Japanese Government had `` no claim whatever to make on the sovereignty of the island , but that if any subjects are found on the island the Imperial Government expects that they should be properly protected as long as they are engaged in peaceful occupations .

In the eighth , ninth , tenth , and fourteenth seasons , a double elimination then took place in the week following the activation of the save , but in the eleventh and thirteenth seasons , a regular single elimination took place . The save was not activated in the twelfth season and consequently , a non-elimination took place in the week after its expiration with the votes then carrying over into the following week . The `` Fan Save '' was introduced in the fourteenth season . During the finals , viewers were given a five - minute window to vote for the contestants in danger of elimination by using their Twitter account to decide which contestant will move on to the next show , starting with the Top 8 . Season finale ( edit ) The finale was the two - hour last episode of the season , culminating in revealing the winner . For seasons one , three through six , fourteen , and fifteen it was broadcast from the Dolby Theatre , which has an audience capacity of approximately 3,400 . The finale for season two took place at the Gibson Amphitheatre , which has an audience capacity of over 6,000 . In seasons seven through thirteen , the venue was at the Nokia Theater , which holds an audience of over 7,000 . Rewards for winner and finalists ( edit ) The winner received a record deal with a major label , which may be for up to six albums , and secures a management contract with American Idol - affiliated 19 Management ( which has the right of first refusal to sign all contestants ) , as well as various lucrative contracts . All winners prior to season nine reportedly earned at least $1 million in their first year as winner . All the runners - up of the first ten seasons , as well as some of other finalists , had also received record deals with major labels . However , starting in season 11 , the runner - up may only be guaranteed a single - only deal . BMG / Sony ( seasons 1 -- 9 ) and UMG ( season 10 -- 15 ) had the right of first refusal to sign contestants for three months after the season 's finale . Starting in the fourteenth season , the winner was signed with Big Machine Records . Prominent music mogul Clive Davis also produced some of the selected contestants ' albums , such as Kelly Clarkson , Clay Aiken , Fantasia Barrino and Diana DeGarmo .

As a side effect of the electrochemical processes used by neurons for signaling , brain tissue generates electric fields when it is active . When large numbers of neurons show synchronized activity , the electric fields that they generate can be large enough to detect outside the skull , using electroencephalography ( EEG ) or magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) . EEG recordings , along with recordings made from electrodes implanted inside the brains of animals such as rats , show that the brain of a living animal is constantly active , even during sleep . Each part of the brain shows a mixture of rhythmic and nonrhythmic activity , which may vary according to behavioral state . In mammals , the cerebral cortex tends to show large slow delta waves during sleep , faster alpha waves when the animal is awake but inattentive , and chaotic - looking irregular activity when the animal is actively engaged in a task . During an epileptic seizure , the brain 's inhibitory control mechanisms fail to function and electrical activity rises to pathological levels , producing EEG traces that show large wave and spike patterns not seen in a healthy brain . Relating these population - level patterns to the computational functions of individual neurons is a major focus of current research in neurophysiology . Metabolism All vertebrates have a blood -- brain barrier that allows metabolism inside the brain to operate differently from metabolism in other parts of the body . Glial cells play a major role in brain metabolism by controlling the chemical composition of the fluid that surrounds neurons , including levels of ions and nutrients . Brain tissue consumes a large amount of energy in proportion to its volume , so large brains place severe metabolic demands on animals . The need to limit body weight in order , for example , to fly , has apparently led to selection for a reduction of brain size in some species , such as bats . Most of the brain 's energy consumption goes into sustaining the electric charge ( membrane potential ) of neurons . Most vertebrate species devote between 2 % and 8 % of basal metabolism to the brain . In primates , however , the percentage is much higher -- in humans it rises to 20 -- 25 % . The energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time , but active regions of the cerebral cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions ; this forms the basis for the functional brain imaging methods PET , fMRI , and NIRS . The brain typically gets most of its energy from oxygen - dependent metabolism of glucose ( i.e. , blood sugar ) , but ketones provide a major alternative source , together with contributions from medium chain fatty acids ( caprylic and heptanoic acids ) , lactate , acetate , and possibly amino acids . Functions Model of a neural circuit in the cerebellum , as proposed by James S. Albus . Information from the sense organs is collected in the brain . There it is used to determine what actions the organism is to take . The brain processes the raw data to extract information about the structure of the environment . Next it combines the processed information with information about the current needs of the animal and with memory of past circumstances . Finally , on the basis of the results , it generates motor response patterns . These signal - processing tasks require intricate interplay between a variety of functional subsystems . The function of the brain is to provide coherent control over the actions of an animal . A centralized brain allows groups of muscles to be co-activated in complex patterns ; it also allows stimuli impinging on one part of the body to evoke responses in other parts , and it can prevent different parts of the body from acting at cross-purposes to each other",

Built in Belfast , Ireland , in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ( as it was then known ) , the RMS Titanic was the second of the three Olympic - class ocean liners -- the first was the RMS Olympic and the third was the HMHS Britannic . They were by far the largest vessels of the British shipping company White Star Line 's fleet , which comprised 29 steamers and tenders in 1912 . The three ships had their genesis in a discussion in mid-1907 between the White Star Line 's chairman , J. Bruce Ismay , and the American financier J.P. Morgan , who controlled the White Star Line 's parent corporation , the International Mercantile Marine Co . ( IMM ) . The White Star Line faced an increasing challenge from its main rivals Cunard , which had recently launched the Lusitania and the Mauretania -- the fastest passenger ships then in service -- and the German lines Hamburg America and Norddeutscher Lloyd .

The White Star Line faced an increasing challenge from its main rivals Cunard , which had recently launched the Lusitania and the Mauretania -- the fastest passenger ships then in service -- and the German lines Hamburg America and Norddeutscher Lloyd . Ismay preferred to compete on size rather than speed and proposed to commission a new class of liners that would be larger than anything that had gone before as well as being the last word in comfort and luxury . The company sought an upgrade in their fleet primarily in response to the Cunard giants but also to replace their oldest pair of passenger ships still in service , being the SS Teutonic of 1889 and SS Majestic of 1890 . Teutonic was replaced by Olympic while Majestic was replaced by Titanic . Majestic would be brought back into her old spot on White Star 's New York service after Titanic 's loss . The ships were constructed by the Belfast shipbuilders Harland and Wolff , who had a long - established relationship with the White Star Line dating back to 1867 . Harland and Wolff were given a great deal of latitude in designing ships for the White Star Line ; the usual approach was for the latter to sketch out a general concept which the former would take away and turn into a ship design . Cost considerations were relatively low on the agenda and Harland and Wolff was authorised to spend what it needed on the ships , plus a five percent profit margin . In the case of the Olympic - class ships , a cost of \u00a3 3 million ( \u00a3 250 million in 2015 money ) for the first two ships was agreed plus `` extras to contract '' and the usual five percent fee . Harland and Wolff put their leading designers to work designing the Olympic - class vessels . The design was overseen by Lord Pirrie , a director of both Harland and Wolff and the White Star Line ; naval architect Thomas Andrews , the managing director of Harland and Wolff 's design department ; Edward Wilding , Andrews ' deputy and responsible for calculating the ship 's design , stability and trim ; and Alexander Carlisle , the shipyard 's chief draughtsman and general manager . Carlisle 's responsibilities included the decorations , equipment and all general arrangements , including the implementation of an efficient lifeboat davit design . On 29 July 1908 , Harland and Wolff presented the drawings to J. Bruce Ismay and other White Star Line executives . Ismay approved the design and signed three `` letters of agreement '' two days later , authorising the start of construction . At this point the first ship -- which was later to become Olympic -- had no name , but was referred to simply as `` Number 400 '' , as it was Harland and Wolff 's four hundredth hull . Titanic was based on a revised version of the same design and was given the number 401 . Dimensions and layout Titanic in 1912 Titanic was 882 feet 9 inches ( 269.06 m ) long with a maximum breadth of 92 feet 6 inches ( 28.19 m ) .

Georgia , reducing all death sentences pending at the time to life imprisonment . Subsequently , a majority of states passed new death penalty statutes , and the court affirmed the legality of capital punishment in the 1976 case Gregg v. Georgia . Since then , more than 7,800 defendants have been sentenced to death ; of these , more than 1,400 have been executed , 161 who were sentenced to death before and after 1976 were exonerated of their conviction before their execution in the modern era. and more than 2,900 are still on death row .

The Fourteenth Amendment adopted in 1868 also requires a due process of law for deprivation of life by any state . The Espy file , compiled by M.

From 1930 to 2002 , there were 4,661 executions in the U.S. , about two - thirds of them in the first 20 years . Additionally , the United States Army executed 135 soldiers between 1916 and 1955 ( the most recent ) . Early Abolition movement ( edit ) Three states abolished the death penalty for murder during the 19th century : Michigan in 1846 ( has never executed a prisoner since achieving statehood ) , Wisconsin in 1853 and Maine in 1887 . Rhode Island is also a state with a long abolitionist background , having repealed the death penalty in 1852 , though it was theoretically available for murder committed by a prisoner between 1872 and 1984 . Other states which abolished the death penalty for murder before Gregg v. Georgia include : Minnesota in 1911 , Vermont in 1964 , Iowa and West Virginia in 1965 and North Dakota in 1973 . Hawaii abolished the death penalty in 1948 and Alaska in 1957 , both before their statehood . Puerto Rico repealed it in 1929 and the District of Columbia in 1981 . Arizona and Oregon abolished the death penalty by popular vote in 1916 and 1964 respectively , but both reinstated it , again by popular vote , some years later : Arizona in 1918 and Oregon in 1978 . Puerto Rico and Michigan are the only two U.S. jurisdictions to have explicitly prohibited capital punishment in their constitutions : in 1952 and 1964 , respectively . Constitutional law developments ( edit ) Nevertheless , capital punishment continued to be used by a majority of states and the federal government for various crimes , especially murder and rape , from the creation of the United States up to the beginning of the 1960s . Until then , `` save for a few mavericks , no one gave any credence to the possibility of ending the death penalty by judicial interpretation of constitutional law '' , according to abolitionist Hugo Bedau . The possibility of challenging the constitutionality of the death penalty became progressively more realistic after the Supreme Court of the United States decided Trop v. Dulles in 1958 , when the court said explicitly for the first time that the Eighth Amendment 's cruel and unusual clause must draw its meaning from the `` evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society '' , rather than from its original meaning .

Also in the 1932 case Powell v. Alabama , the court made the first step of what would be later be called `` death is different '' jurisprudence , when it held that any indigent defendant was entitled to a court - appointed attorney in capital cases - a right that was only later extended to non-capital defendants in 1963 , with Gideon v. Wainwright . Capital punishment suspended ( 1972 ) ( edit ) Further information : Furman v. Georgia Executions in the United States since 1960 In Furman v. Georgia , the U.S. Supreme Court considered a group of consolidated cases . The lead case involved an individual convicted under Georgia 's death penalty statute , which featured a `` unitary trial '' procedure in which the jury was asked to return a verdict of guilt or innocence and , simultaneously , determine whether the defendant would be punished by death or life imprisonment . The last pre-Furman execution was that of Luis Monge on June 2 , 1967 . In a 5 - 4 decision , the Supreme Court struck down the impositions of the death penalty in each of the consolidated cases as unconstitutional in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution . The Supreme Court has never ruled the death penalty to be per se unconstitutional . The five justices in the majority did not produce a common opinion or rationale for their decision , however , and agreed only on a short statement announcing the result . The narrowest opinions , those of Byron White and Potter Stewart , expressed generalized concerns about the inconsistent application of the death penalty across a variety of cases , but did not exclude the possibility of a constitutional death penalty law . Stewart and William O. Douglas worried explicitly about racial discrimination in enforcement of the death penalty . Thurgood Marshall and William J. Brennan Jr. expressed the opinion that the death penalty was proscribed absolutely by the Eighth Amendment as cruel and unusual punishment . The Furman decision caused all death sentences pending at the time to be reduced to life imprisonment , and was described by scholars as a `` legal bombshell '' . The next day , columnist Barry Schweid wrote that it was `` unlikely '' that the death penalty could exist anymore in the United States . Capital punishment reinstated ( 1976 ) ( edit ) Further information : Gregg v. Georgia U.S. Supreme Court seat in Washington , D.C. Instead of abandoning capital punishment , 37 states enacted new death penalty statutes that attempted to address the concerns of White and Stewart in Furman . Some states responded by enacting mandatory death penalty statutes which prescribed a sentence of death for anyone convicted of certain forms of murder . White had hinted that such a scheme would meet his constitutional concerns in his Furman opinion . Other states adopted `` bifurcated '' trial and sentencing procedures , with various procedural limitations on the jury 's ability to pronounce a death sentence designed to limit juror discretion .

The path of totality touched 14 states , and the rest of the U.S. had a partial eclipse . The area of the path of totality was about 16 percent of the area of the United States , with most of this area over the ocean , not land .

Mars was 8 degrees to the right , and Venus 34 degrees right . Mercury was 10 degrees left , and Jupiter 51 degrees left . Other eclipses over the United States ( edit ) This was the first total solar eclipse visible from the United States since that of July 11 , 1991 -- which was seen only from part of Hawaii -- and the first visible from the contiguous United States since 1979 . An eclipse of comparable length ( up to 3 minutes , 8 seconds , with the longest eclipse being 6 minutes and 54 seconds ) occurred over the contiguous United States on March 7 , 1970 along the southern portions of the Eastern Seaboard , from Florida to Virginia . The path of totality of the solar eclipse of February 26 , 1979 crossed only the states of Washington , Oregon , Idaho , Montana , and North Dakota . Many enthusiasts traveled to the Pacific Northwest to view the eclipse , since it would be the last chance to view such an eclipse in the contiguous United States for almost four decades . Some American scientists and interested amateurs who wanted to experience a total eclipse participated in a four - day Atlantic Ocean cruise to view the solar eclipse of July 10 , 1972 as it passed near Nova Scotia . ( This is referenced in the Carly Simon hit song `` You 're So Vain '' in the lyric , `` Then you flew your Lear Jet up to Nova Scotia to see the total eclipse of the Sun . '' ) Organizers of the cruise advertised in astronomical journals and in planetarium announcements , emphasizing the rarity of the event . The path of totality across the United States The August 2017 eclipse was the first with a path of totality crossing the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of the U.S. since 1918 . Also , its path of totality made landfall exclusively within the United States , making it the first such eclipse since the country 's declaration of independence in 1776 . Prior to this , the path of totality of the eclipse of June 13 , 1257 , was the last to make landfall exclusively on lands currently part of the United States . The path of the 2017 eclipse crosses with the path of the upcoming total solar eclipse of April 8 , 2024 , with the intersection of the two paths being in southern Illinois in Makanda Township at Cedar Lake , just south of Carbondale . An area of about 9,000 square miles , including the cities of Makanda , Carbondale , Cape Girardeau , Missouri , and Paducah , Kentucky , will thus experience two total solar eclipses within a span of less than seven years . The cities of Benton , Carbondale , Chester , Harrisburg , Marion , and Metropolis in Illinois ; Cape Girardeau , Farmington , and Perryville in Missouri , as well as Paducah , Kentucky , will also be in the path of the 2024 eclipse , thereby earning the distinction of witnessing two total solar eclipses in seven years . The solar eclipse of August 12 , 2045 will have a very similar path of totality over the U.S. to the 2017 eclipse : about 400 km ( 250 mi ) to the southwest , also crossing the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of the country ; however , totality will be more than twice as long .

The survey was detailed enough to determine that the best southern route lay south of the Gila River boundary with Mexico in mostly vacant desert , through the future territories of Arizona and New Mexico . This in part motivated the United States to complete the Gadsden Purchase . In 1856 the Select Committee on the Pacific Railroad and Telegraph of the US House of Representatives published a report recommending support for a proposed Pacific railroad bill : The necessity that now exists for constructing lines of railroad and telegraphic communication between the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of this continent is no longer a question for argument ; it is conceded by every one . In order to maintain our present position on the Pacific , we must have some more speedy and direct means of intercourse than is at present afforded by the route through the possessions of a foreign power . Possible routes ( edit ) The U.S. Congress was strongly divided on where the eastern terminus of the railroad should be -- in a southern or northern city . Three routes were considered : A northern route roughly along the Missouri River through present - day northern Montana to Oregon Territory . This was considered impractical due to the rough terrain and extensive winter snows . A central route following the Platte River in Nebraska through to the South Pass in Wyoming , following most of the Oregon Trail. Snow on this route remained a concern . A southern route across Texas , New Mexico Territory , the Sonora desert , connecting to Los Angeles , California . Surveyors found during a 1848 survey that the best route lay south of the border between the United States and Mexico . This was resolved by the Gadsden Purchase in 1853 . Once the central route was chosen , it was immediately obvious that the western terminus should be Sacramento . But there was considerable difference of opinion about the eastern terminus . Three locations along 250 miles ( 400 km ) of Missouri River were considered : St. Joseph , Missouri , accessed via the Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad . Kansas City , Kansas / Leavenworth , Kansas accessed via the Leavenworth , Pawnee and Western Railroad , controlled by Thomas Ewing Jr. and later by John C. Fremont . Council Bluffs , Iowa / Omaha , Nebraska , accessed via an extension of Union Pacific financier Thomas C. Durant 's proposed Mississippi and Missouri Railroad and the new Union Pacific Railroad , also controlled by Durant . Council Bluffs had several advantages : It was well north of the Civil War fighting in Missouri ; it was the shortest route to South Pass in the Rockies in Wyoming ; and it would follow a fertile river that would encourage settlement . Durant had hired Lincoln in 1857 when he was an attorney to represent him in a business matter about a bridge over the Missouri . Now Lincoln was responsible for choosing the eastern terminus , and he relied on Durant 's counsel . Durant advocated for Omaha , and he was so confident of the choice that he began buying up land in Nebraska .

He envisioned a route from Chicago and the Great Lakes to northern California , paid for by the sale of land to settlers along the route . Whitney traveled widely to solicit support from businessmen and politicians , printed maps and pamphlets , and submitted several proposals to Congress , all at his own expense . In June 1845 , he led a team along part of the proposed route to assess its feasibility . Legislation to begin construction of the Pacific Railroad ( called the Memorial of Asa Whitney ) was first introduced to Congress by Representative Zadock Pratt . Congress did not immediately act on Whitney 's proposal . Theodore Judah ( edit ) Main article : Theodore Judah Theodore Judah , architect of the Transcontinental Railroad and first chief engineer of the Central Pacific . Lewis M. Clement , Chief Assistant Engineer and Superintendent of Track The next big champion of the central route was Theodore Judah , who undertook to survey a manageable route through what was one of the chief obstacles of a central route to California , the high and rugged Sierra Nevada . In 1852 , Judah was chief engineer for the newly formed Sacramento Valley Railroad , the first railroad built west of the Mississippi River . Although the railroad later went bankrupt once the easy placer gold deposits around Placerville , California were depleted , Judah was convinced that a properly financed railroad could pass from Sacramento through the Sierra Nevada mountains to reach the Great Basin and hook up with rail lines coming from the East . In 1856 , Judah wrote a 13,000 - word proposal in support of a Pacific railroad and distributed it to Cabinet secretaries , congressmen and other influential people . In September 1859 , Judah was chosen to be the accredited lobbyist for the Pacific Railroad Convention , which indeed approved his plan to survey , finance and engineer the road . Judah returned to Washington in December 1859 . He had a lobbying office in the United States Capitol , received an audience with President James Buchanan , and represented the Convention before Congress . Judah returned to California in 1860 . He continued to search for a more practical route through the Sierra suitable for a railroad . In mid-1860 , local miner Daniel Strong had surveyed a route over the Sierra for a wagon toll road , which he realized would also suit a railroad . He described his discovery in a letter to Judah . Together , they formed an association to solicit subscriptions from local merchants and businessmen to support their proposed railroad . From January or February 1861 until July , Judah and Strong led a 10 - person expedition to survey the route for the railroad over the Sierra Nevada through Clipper Gap and Emigrant Gap , over Donner Pass , and south to Truckee . They discovered a way across the Sierras that was gradual enough to be made suitable for a railroad , although it still needed a lot of work .

Formation The Sun formed about 4.6 billion years ago from the collapse of part of a giant molecular cloud that consisted mostly of hydrogen and helium and that probably gave birth to many other stars . This age is estimated using computer models of stellar evolution and through nucleocosmochronology . The result is consistent with the radiometric date of the oldest Solar System material , at 4.567 billion years ago . Studies of ancient meteorites reveal traces of stable daughter nuclei of short - lived isotopes , such as iron - 60 , that form only in exploding , short - lived stars . This indicates that one or more supernovae must have occurred near the location where the Sun formed . A shock wave from a nearby supernova would have triggered the formation of the Sun by compressing the matter within the molecular cloud and causing certain regions to collapse under their own gravity . As one fragment of the cloud collapsed it also began to rotate because of conservation of angular momentum and heat up with the increasing pressure . Much of the mass became concentrated in the center , whereas the rest flattened out into a disk that would become the planets and other Solar System bodies . Gravity and pressure within the core of the cloud generated a lot of heat as it accreted more matter from the surrounding disk , eventually triggering nuclear fusion . Thus , the Sun was born . Main sequence Evolution of the Sun 's luminosity , radius and effective temperature compared to the present Sun . After Ribas ( 2010 ) The Sun is about halfway through its main - sequence stage , during which nuclear fusion reactions in its core fuse hydrogen into helium . Each second , more than four million tonnes of matter are converted into energy within the Sun 's core , producing neutrinos and solar radiation . At this rate , the Sun has so far converted around 100 times the mass of Earth into energy , about 0.03 % of the total mass of the Sun . The Sun will spend a total of approximately 10 billion years as a main - sequence star . The Sun is gradually becoming hotter during its time on the main sequence , because the helium atoms in the core occupy less volume than the hydrogen atoms that were fused . The core is therefore shrinking , allowing the outer layers of the Sun to move closer to the centre and experience a stronger gravitational force , according to the inverse - square law . This stronger force increases the pressure on the core , which is resisted by a gradual increase in the rate at which fusion occurs . This process speeds up as the core gradually becomes denser . It is estimated that the Sun has become 30 % brighter in the last 4.5 billion years . At present , it is increasing in brightness by about 1 % every 100 million years . After core hydrogen exhaustion The size of the current Sun ( now in the main sequence ) compared to its estimated size during its red - giant phase in the future The Sun does not have enough mass to explode as a supernova . Instead it will exit the main sequence in approximately 5 billion years and start to turn into a red giant . As a red giant , the Sun will grow so large that it will engulf Mercury , Venus , and probably Earth . Even before it becomes a red giant , the luminosity of the Sun will have nearly doubled , and Earth will receive as much sunlight as Venus receives today . Once the core hydrogen is exhausted in 5.4 billion years , the Sun will expand into a subgiant phase and slowly double in size over about half a",

          "full_text": "AU . According to a 2008 model , Earth 's orbit is shrinking due to tidal forces ( and , eventually , drag from the lower chromosphere ) , so that it will be engulfed by the Sun near the tip of the red giant branch phase , 1 and 3.8 million years after Mercury and Venus have respectively suffered the same fate . Models vary depending on the rate and timing of mass loss . Models that have higher mass loss on the red - giant branch produce smaller , less luminous stars at the tip of the asymptotic giant branch , perhaps only 2,000 times the luminosity and less than 200 times the radius . For the Sun , four thermal pulses are predicted before it completely loses its outer envelope and starts to make a planetary nebula . By the end of that phase -- lasting approximately 500,000 years -- the Sun will only have about half of its current mass . The post-asymptotic - giant - branch evolution is even faster . The luminosity stays approximately constant as the temperature increases , with the ejected half of the Sun 's mass becoming ionised into a planetary nebula as the exposed core reaches 30,000 K . The final naked core , a white dwarf , will have a temperature of over 100,000 K , and contain an estimated 54.05 % of the Sun 's present day mass . The planetary nebula will disperse in about 10,000 years , but the white dwarf will survive for trillions of years before fading to a hypothetical black dwarf . Motion and location Illustration of the Milky Way , showing the location of the Sun The Sun lies close to the inner rim of the Milky Way 's Orion Arm , in the Local Interstellar Cloud or the Gould Belt , at a distance of 7.5 -- 8.5 kpc ( 25,000 -- 28,000 light - years ) from the Galactic Center . The Sun is contained within the Local Bubble , a space of rarefied hot gas , possibly produced by the supernova remnant Geminga , or multiple supernovae in subgroup B1 of the Pleiades moving group . The distance between the local arm and the next arm out , the Perseus Arm , is about 6,500 light - years . The Sun , and thus the Solar System , is found in what scientists call the galactic habitable zone . The Apex of the Sun 's Way , or the solar apex , is the direction that the Sun travels relative to other nearby stars . This motion is towards a point in the constellation Hercules , near the star Vega . Of the 50 nearest stellar systems within 17 light - years from Earth ( the closest being the red dwarf Proxima Centauri at approximately 4.2 light - years ) , the Sun ranks fourth in mass . Orbit in Milky Way The Sun orbits the center of the Milky Way , and it is presently moving in the direction of the constellation of Cygnus . A simple model of the motion of a star in the galaxy gives the galactic coordinates X , Y , and Z as : X ( t ) = X ( 0 ) + U ( 0 ) \u03ba sin \u2061 ( \u03ba t ) + V ( 0 ) 2 B ( 1 \u2212 cos \u2061 ( \u03ba t ) ) ( \\ displaystyle X ( t ) = X ( 0 ) + ( \\ frac ( U ( 0 ) ) ( \\ kappa ) ) \\ sin ( \\ kappa t ) + ( \\ frac ( V ( 0 ) ) ( 2B ) ) (",

Instead it will exit the main sequence in approximately 5 billion years and start to turn into a red giant . As a red giant , the Sun will grow so large that it will engulf Mercury , Venus , and probably Earth . Even before it becomes a red giant , the luminosity of the Sun will have nearly doubled , and Earth will receive as much sunlight as Venus receives today . Once the core hydrogen is exhausted in 5.4 billion years , the Sun will expand into a subgiant phase and slowly double in size over about half a billion years . It will then expand more rapidly over about half a billion years until it is over two hundred times larger than today and a couple of thousand times more luminous . This then starts the red - giant - branch phase where the Sun will spend around a billion years and lose around a third of its mass . Evolution of a Sun - like star . The track of a one solar mass star on the Hertzsprung -- Russell diagram is shown from the main sequence to the post-asymptotic - giant - branch stage . After the red - giant branch the Sun has approximately 120 million years of active life left , but much happens . First , the core , full of degenerate helium ignites violently in the helium flash , where it is estimated that 6 % of the core , itself 40 % of the Sun 's mass , will be converted into carbon within a matter of minutes through the triple - alpha process . The Sun then shrinks to around 10 times its current size and 50 times the luminosity , with a temperature a little lower than today . It will then have reached the red clump or horizontal branch , but a star of the Sun 's mass does not evolve blueward along the horizontal branch . Instead , it just becomes moderately larger and more luminous over about 100 million years as it continues to burn helium in the core . When the helium is exhausted , the Sun will repeat the expansion it followed when the hydrogen in the core was exhausted , except that this time it all happens faster , and the Sun becomes larger and more luminous . This is the asymptotic - giant - branch phase , and the Sun is alternately burning hydrogen in a shell or helium in a deeper shell . After about 20 million years on the early asymptotic giant branch , the Sun becomes increasingly unstable , with rapid mass loss and thermal pulses that increase the size and luminosity for a few hundred years every 100,000 years or so . The thermal pulses become larger each time , with the later pulses pushing the luminosity to as much as 5,000 times the current level and the radius to over 1 AU . According to a 2008 model , Earth 's orbit is shrinking due to tidal forces ( and , eventually , drag from the lower chromosphere ) , so that it will be engulfed by the Sun near the tip of the red giant branch phase , 1 and 3.8 million years after Mercury and Venus have respectively suffered the same fate . Models vary depending on the rate and timing of mass loss . Models that have higher mass loss on the red - giant branch produce smaller , less luminous stars at the tip of the asymptotic giant branch , perhaps only 2,000 times the luminosity and less than 200 times the radius . For the Sun , four thermal pulses are predicted before it completely loses its outer envelope and",

This article caught the attention of comics publisher Max Gaines , who hired Marston as an educational consultant for National Periodicals and All - American Publications , two of the companies that would merge to form DC Comics . At that time , Marston wanted to create his own new superhero ; Marston 's wife and fellow psychologist Elizabeth suggested to him that it should be a woman : William Moulton Marston , a psychologist already famous for inventing the polygraph , struck upon an idea for a new kind of superhero , one who would triumph not with fists or firepower , but with love . `` Fine , '' said Elizabeth . `` But make her a woman . '' Marston introduced the idea to Gaines . Given the go - ahead , Marston developed Wonder Woman , whom he believed to be a model of that era 's unconventional , liberated woman . Marston also drew inspiration from the bracelets worn by Olive Byrne , who lived with the couple in a polyamorous relationship . Wonder Woman debuted in All Star Comics # 8 ( cover date Dec / Jan 1941 / 1942 , released in October 1941 ) , scripted by Marston . Marston was the creator of a systolic - blood - pressure - measuring apparatus , which was crucial to the development of the polygraph ( lie detector ) . Marston 's experience",

The first vehicle sold under this name was the Toyopet SA , but it also included vehicles such as the Toyopet SB light truck , Toyopet Stout light truck , Toyopet Crown , Toyopet Master , and the Toyopet Corona . The word `` Toyopet ( Japanese article ) '' was a nickname given to the Toyota SA due to its small size , as the result of a naming contest the Toyota Company organized in 1947 . However , when Toyota eventually entered the American market in 1957 with the Crown , the name was not well received due to connotations of toys and pets . The name was soon dropped for the American market , but continued in other markets until the mid-1960s . 1960s -- 1970s ( edit ) By the early 1960s , the US had begun placing stiff import tariffs on certain vehicles . The so - called `` chicken tax '' of 1964 placed a 25 % tax on imported light trucks . In response to the tariff , Toyota , Nissan Motor Co. and Honda Motor Co. began building plants in the US by the early 1980s . 1980s ( edit ) With over 40 million sold , the Corolla is one of the most popular and best selling cars in the world .

In part due to this , Nissan 's Sunny managed to squeeze by the Corolla in numbers built that year . In 1982 , the Toyota Motor Company and Toyota Motor Sales merged into one company , the Toyota Motor Corporation . Two years later , Toyota entered into a joint venture with General Motors called the New United Motor Manufacturing , Inc , NUMMI , operating an automobile - manufacturing plant in Fremont , California . The factory was an old General Motors plant that had been closed for two years . Toyota then started to establish new brands at the end of the 1980s , with the launch of their luxury division Lexus in 1989 . 1990s ( edit ) In the 1990s , Toyota began to branch out from producing mostly compact cars by adding many larger and more luxurious vehicles to its lineup , including a full - sized pickup , the T100 ( and later the Tundra ) , several lines of SUVs , a sport version of the Camry , known as the Camry Solara , and the Scion brand . They would also launch newer and arguably more iconic iterations of their sports cars , namely the MR2 , Celica , and Supra during this era , all of which have already become icons of the 1990s . With a major presence in Europe , due to the success of Toyota Team Europe , the corporation decided to set up Toyota Motor Europe Marketing and Engineering , TMME , to help market vehicles in the continent . Two years later , Toyota set up a base in the United Kingdom , TMUK , as the company 's cars had become very popular among British drivers . Bases in Indiana , Virginia , and Tianjin were also set up . In 1999 , the company decided to list itself on the New York and London Stock Exchanges . 2000s ( edit ) In 2001 , Toyota 's Toyo Trust and Banking merged with two other banks to form UFJ Bank , which was accused of corruption by Japan 's government for making bad loans to alleged Yakuza crime syndicates with executives accused of blocking Financial Service Agency inspections . The UFJ was listed among Fortune Magazine 's largest money - losing corporations in the world , with Toyota 's chairman serving as a director . At the time , the UFJ was one of the largest shareholders of Toyota . As a result of Japan 's banking crisis , UFJ merged with the Bank of Tokyo - Mitsubishi to become the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group .

The company was number one in global automobile sales for the first quarter of 2008 . In 2007 , Toyota released an update of its full - sized truck , the Tundra , produced in two American factories , one in Texas and one in Indiana . Motor Trend named the Tundra `` Truck of the Year '' , and the 2007 Toyota Camry `` Car of the Year '' for 2007 . It also began the construction of two new factories , one to build the RAV4 in Woodstock , Ontario , Canada , and the other to build the Toyota Prius in Blue Springs , Mississippi , USA . This plant was originally intended to build the Toyota Highlander , but Toyota decided to use the plant in Princeton , Indiana , USA , instead . The company has also found recent success with its smaller models -- the Corolla and Yaris . 2010s ( edit ) In 2011 , Toyota , along with large parts of the Japanese automotive industry , suffered from a series of natural disasters . The 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami led to a severe disruption of the supplier base and a drop in production and exports . Severe flooding during the 2011 monsoon season in Thailand affected Japanese automakers that had chosen Thailand as a production base . Toyota is estimated to have lost production of 150,000 units to the tsunami and production of 240,000 units to the floods . On February 10 , 2014 , it was announced that Toyota would cease manufacturing vehicles and engines in Australia by the end of 2017 . The decision was based on the unfavourable Australian dollar making exports not viable , the high cost of local manufacture and the high amount of competition in a relatively small local market . The company plans to consolidate its corporate functions in Melbourne by the end of 2017 . The head office will remain in Port Melbourne and the Altona plant will be retained for other functions . The workforce is expected to be reduced from 3,900 to 1,300 . The automaker narrowly topped global sales for the first half of 2014 , selling 5.1 million vehicles in the six months ending June 30 , 2014 , an increase of 3.8 % on the same period the previous year . Volkswagen AG , which recorded sales of 5.07 million vehicles , was close behind . In August 2014 , Toyota announced it would be cutting its spare - parts prices in China by up to 35 % . The company admitted the move was in response to a probe foreshadowed earlier in the month by China 's National Development and Reform Commission of Toyota 's Lexus spare - parts policies , as part of an industry - wide investigation into what the Chinese regulator considers exorbitantly high prices being charged by automakers for spare parts and after - sales servicing .

George Whitefield and John 's brother Charles Wesley were also significant early leaders in the movement . It originated as a revival within the 18th century Church of England and became a separate denomination after Wesley 's death . The movement spread throughout the British Empire , the United States , and beyond because of vigorous missionary work , today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide . Wesley 's theology focused on sanctification and the effect of faith on the character of a Christian . Distinguishing Methodist doctrines include an assurance of salvation , imparted righteousness , the possibility of perfection in love , the works of piety , and the primacy of Scripture . Most Methodists teach that Jesus Christ , the Son of God , died for all of humanity and that salvation is available for all ; in theology , this view is known as Arminianism . This teaching rejects the Calvinist position that God has pre-ordained the salvation of a select group of people . However , Whitefield and several others were considered Calvinistic Methodists and held to the Calvinistic position . Methodism emphasises charity and support for the sick , the poor , and the afflicted through the works of mercy . These ideals are put into practice by the establishment of hospitals , orphanages , soup kitchens , and schools to follow Christ 's command to spread the gospel and serve all people . The movement has a wide variety of forms of worship , ranging from high church to low church in liturgical usage . Denominations that descend from the British Methodist tradition are generally less ritualistic , while American Methodism is more so , the United Methodist Church in particular . Methodism is known for its rich musical tradition , and Charles Wesley was instrumental in writing much of the hymnody of the Methodist Church . Early Methodists were drawn from all levels of society , including the aristocracy , but the Methodist preachers took the message to labourers and criminals who tended to be left outside organised religion at that time . In Britain , the Methodist Church had a major effect in the early decades of the developing working class ( 1760 -- 1820 ) . In the United States , it became the religion of many slaves who later formed ``",

'' Other attacks against the Methodists were physically violent -- Wesley was nearly murdered by a mob at Wednesbury in 1743 . The Methodists responded vigorously to their critics and thrived despite the attacks against them . Separation from the Anglican Church ( edit ) See also : History of Methodism in the United States and John Wesley \u00a7 Persecutions and lay preaching The first Methodist chapel , `` The Foundery '' , London . Initially , the Methodists merely sought reform within the Church of England ( Anglicanism ) , but the movement gradually departed from that Church . George Whitefield 's preference for extemporaneous prayer rather than the fixed forms of prayer in the BCP , in addition to his insistence on the necessity of the New Birth , set him at odds with Anglican clergy . As Methodist societies multiplied , and elements of an ecclesiastical system were , one after another , adopted , the breach between John Wesley and the Church of England gradually widened . In 1784 , Wesley responded to the shortage of priests in the American colonies due to the American Revolutionary War by ordaining preachers for America with power to administer the sacraments . This was a major reason for Methodism 's final split from the Church of England after Wesley 's death . This split created a separate , eventually worldwide , group of church denominations . With regard to the position of Methodism within Christendom , `` John Wesley once noted that what God had achieved in the development of Methodism was no mere human endeavor but the work of God . As such it would be preserved by God so long as history remained . '' The influence of Whitefield and Lady Huntingdon on the Church of England was a factor in the founding of the Free Church of England in 1844 . At the time of Wesley 's death there were over 500 Methodist preachers in British colonies and the United States . Total membership of the Methodist societies in Britain was recorded as 56,000 in 1791 , rising to 360,000 in 1836 and 1,463,000 by the national census of 1851 . Early Methodism experienced a radical and spiritual phase that allowed women authority in church leadership . The role of the woman preacher emerged from the sense that the home should be a place of community care and should foster personal growth . Methodist women formed a community that cared for the vulnerable , extending the role of mothering beyond physical care . Women were encouraged to testify their faith . However the centrality of women 's role sharply diminished after 1790 as Methodist churches became more structured and more male dominated . The Wesleyan Education Committee , which existed from 1838 to 1902 , has documented the Methodist Church 's involvement in the education of children . At first most effort was placed in creating Sunday Schools but in 1836 the British Methodist Conference gave its blessing to the creation of `` Weekday schools '' . Methodism spread throughout the British Empire and , mostly through Whitefield 's preaching during what historians call the First Great Awakening , in colonial America . After Whitefield 's death in 1770 , however , American Methodism entered a more lasting Wesleyan and Arminian phase of development .

However , these `` seasons '' only correspond to story arcs ( which are themselves split at debatable points ) , and not to the pattern in which the show actually aired in either Japan or the United States . In Japan , Dragon Ball Z ( like both of the other Dragon Ball series ) was aired year - round continuously , with regular off - days for sporting events and television specials taking place about once every six weeks on average . Only when the series was broadcast in the United States was the series split into the standard seasonal cycle of new episodes followed by repeats followed by new episodes . The series was broadcast in eight separate near - continuous blocks ( 1 - 35 , 36 - 67 , 68 - 107 , 108 - 116 , 117 - 194 , 195 - 237 , 238 - 276 , and 277 - 291 ) , with breaks varying between four months to over a year between each block . In only one instance ( between episodes 194 and 195 ) was there actually parity between the DVD release and the actual broadcast sequence in terms of the end of one `` season '' and the beginning of the next .

At 02 : 39 UTC on Monday July 21 , 1969 , Armstrong opened the hatch , and at 02 : 51 UTC began his descent to the lunar surface . The Remote Control Unit controls on his chest kept him from seeing his feet . Climbing down the nine - rung ladder , Armstrong pulled a D - ring to deploy the Modular Equipment Stowage Assembly ( MESA ) folded against Eagle 's side and activate the TV camera , and at 02 : 56 : 15 UTC he set his left foot on the surface . The first landing used slow - scan television incompatible with commercial TV , so it was displayed on a special monitor and a conventional TV camera viewed this monitor , significantly reducing the quality of the picture . The signal was received at Goldstone in the United States but with better fidelity by Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station in Australia . Minutes later the feed was switched to the more sensitive Parkes radio telescope in Australia . Despite some technical and weather difficulties , ghostly black and white images of the first lunar EVA were received and broadcast to at least 600 million people on Earth . Although copies of this video in broadcast format were saved and are widely available , recordings of the original slow scan source transmission from the lunar surface were accidentally destroyed during routine magnetic tape re-use at NASA . The plaque left on the ladder of Eagle While still on the ladder , Armstrong uncovered a plaque mounted on the LM descent stage bearing two drawings of Earth ( of the Western and Eastern Hemispheres ) , an inscription , and signatures of the astronauts and President Nixon . The inscription read : Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon , July 1969 A.D. We came in peace for all mankind . After describing the surface dust as `` very fine - grained '' and `` almost like a powder , '' six and a half hours after landing , Armstrong stepped off Eagle 's footpad and declared , `` That 's one small step for ( a ) man , one giant leap for mankind . '' Armstrong intended to say `` That 's one small step for a man '' , but the word `` a '' is not audible in the transmission , and thus was not initially reported by most observers of the live broadcast . When later asked about his quote , Armstrong said he believed he said `` for a man '' , and subsequent printed versions of the quote included the `` a '' in square brackets . One explanation for the absence may be that his accent caused him to slur the words `` for a '' together ; another is the intermittent nature of the audio and video links to Earth , partly because of storms near Parkes Observatory . More recent digital analysis of the tape claims to reveal the `` a '' may have been spoken but obscured by static . That 's one small step ... Problems playing this file ? See media help . About seven minutes after stepping onto the Moon 's surface , Armstrong collected a contingency soil sample using a sample bag on a stick . He then folded the bag and tucked it into a pocket on his right thigh . This was to guarantee there would be some lunar soil brought back in case an emergency required the astronauts to abandon the EVA and return to the LM . Twelve minutes after the contingency sample was collected , Aldrin joined Armstrong on the surface , and described the view with the simple phrase , `` Magnificent desolation .

          "full_text": "Houston , Tranquility Base here . The Eagle has landed . '' Armstrong 's unrehearsed change of call sign from `` Eagle '' to `` Tranquility Base '' emphasized to listeners that landing was complete and successful . Duke mispronounced his reply as he expressed the relief at Mission Control : `` Roger , Twan -- Tranquility , we copy you on the ground . You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue . We 're breathing again . Thanks a lot . '' Two and a half hours after landing , before preparations began for the EVA , Aldrin radioed to Earth : This is the LM pilot . I 'd like to take this opportunity to ask every person listening in , whoever and wherever they may be , to pause for a moment and contemplate the events of the past few hours and to give thanks in his or her own way . He then took communion privately . At this time NASA was still fighting a lawsuit brought by atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair ( who had objected to the Apollo 8 crew reading from the Book of Genesis ) demanding that their astronauts refrain from broadcasting religious activities while in space . As such , Aldrin chose to refrain from directly mentioning taking communion on the Moon . Aldrin was an elder at the Webster Presbyterian Church , and his communion kit was prepared by the pastor of the church , the Rev. Dean Woodruff . Aldrin described communion on the Moon and the involvement of his church and pastor in the October 1970 edition of Guideposts magazine and in his book Return to Earth . Webster Presbyterian possesses the chalice used on the Moon and commemorates the event each year on the Sunday closest to July 20 . The schedule for the mission called for the astronauts to follow the landing with a five - hour sleep period as they had been awake since early morning . However , they elected to forgo the sleep period and begin the preparations for the EVA early , thinking that they would be unable to sleep . Lunar surface operations See also : First Moon walk A mounted slowscan TV camera showing Armstrong as he climbs down the ladder to surface A photograph of Armstrong near the LM , taken by Aldrin on the lunar surface . This is one of the only photographs of Armstrong on the lunar surface ; most of the time he had the camera . The astronauts planned placement of the Early Apollo Scientific Experiment Package ( EASEP ) and the U.S. flag by studying their landing site through Eagle 's twin triangular windows , which gave them a 60 \u00b0 field of view . Preparation required longer than the two hours scheduled . Armstrong initially had some difficulties squeezing through the hatch with his Portable Life Support System ( PLSS ) . According to veteran Moon - walker John Young , a redesign of the LM to incorporate a smaller hatch had not been followed by a redesign of the PLSS backpack , so some of the highest heart rates recorded from Apollo astronauts occurred during LM egress and ingress . Several books indicate early mission timelines had Buzz Aldrin rather than Neil Armstrong as the first man on the Moon . At 02 : 39 UTC on Monday July 21 , 1969 , Armstrong opened the hatch , and at 02 : 51 UTC began his descent to the lunar surface . The Remote Control Unit controls on his chest kept him from seeing his feet . Climbing down the nine - rung ladder , Armstrong pulled a D - ring to deploy the Modular Equipment Stowage Assembly ( MESA ) folded against Eagle 's side and activate the TV camera , and at 02 : 56 : 15 UTC he set his left foot on the surface .

Mission commander Neil Armstrong and pilot Buzz Aldrin , both American , landed the lunar module Eagle on July 20 , 1969 , at 20 : 18 UTC . Armstrong became the first human to step onto the lunar surface six hours after landing on July 21 at 02 : 56 : 15 UTC ; Aldrin joined him about 20 minutes later . They spent about two and a quarter hours together outside the spacecraft , and collected 47.5 pounds ( 21.5 kg ) of lunar material to bring back to Earth . Michael Collins piloted the command module Columbia alone in lunar orbit while they were on the Moon 's surface . Armstrong and Aldrin spent just under a day on the lunar surface before rejoining Columbia in lunar orbit . Apollo 11 was launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island , Florida , on July 16 at 9 : 32 am EDT ( 13 : 32 UTC ) and was the fifth manned mission of NASA 's Apollo program . The Apollo spacecraft had three parts : a command module ( CM ) with a cabin for the three astronauts , and the only part that returned to Earth ; a service module ( SM ) , which supported the command module with propulsion , electrical power , oxygen , and water ; and a lunar module ( LM ) that had two stages -- a descent stage for landing on the Moon , and an ascent stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit . After being sent to the Moon by the Saturn V 's third stage , the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit . Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the lunar module Eagle and landed in the Sea of Tranquility . They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface . The astronauts used Eagle 's upper stage to lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module . They jettisoned Eagle before they performed the maneuvers that blasted them out of lunar orbit on a trajectory back to Earth . They returned to Earth and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 after more than eight days in space . The landing was broadcast on live TV to a worldwide audience . Armstrong stepped onto the lunar surface and described the event as `` one small step for ( a ) man , one giant leap for mankind . '' Apollo 11 effectively ended the Space Race and fulfilled a national goal proposed in 1961 by U.S. President John F. Kennedy : `` before this decade is out , of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth . '' Contents ( hide ) 1 Framework",

Producer Quincy Jones had wanted to include a rock and roll song in the vein of the Knack 's `` My Sharona '' , though Jackson reportedly had never previously shown an interest in the genre . Jackson later said of `` Beat It '' , `` I wanted to write a song , the type of song that I would buy if I were to buy a rock song ... That is how I approached it and I wanted the children to really enjoy it -- the school children as well as the college students . '' Jermaine Jackson has suggested the inspiration of `` Beat It '' and its video came from the Jackson family experiencing gang activity in Gary , Indiana . `` From our front window , we witnessed , about three bad rumbles between rival gangs . '' Upon hearing the first recorded vocals , Jones stated that it was exactly what he was looking for . The song begins with seven distinct synthesizer notes played on the Synclavier digital synthesizer , with Tom Bahler credited for the Synclavier performance on the song . The intro is taken note for note from a demo LP released the year before , called `` The Incredible Sounds of Synclavier II '' first published in 1981 by Denny Jaeger Creative Services , Inc and sold by New England Digital , makers of the Synclavier . Eddie Van Halen , lead guitarist of hard rock band Van Halen , was asked to add a guitar solo . When initially contacted by Jones , Van Halen thought he was receiving a prank call . Having established that the call was genuine , Van Halen borrowed an amplifier from guitarist Allan Holdsworth and recorded his guitar solo free of any charge . `` I did it as a favor '' , the musician later said . `` I was a complete fool , according to the rest of the band , our manager and everyone else . I was not used . I knew what I was doing -- I do n't do something unless I want to do it . '' Van Halen recorded his contribution following Jones and Jackson arriving at the guitarist 's house with a `` skeleton version '' of the song . Fellow guitarist Steve Lukather recalled , `` Initially , we rocked it out as Eddie had played a good solo -- but Quincy thought it was too tough . So I had to reduce the distorted guitar sound and that is what was released . '' The song was among the last four completed for Thriller ; the others were `` Human Nature '' , `` P.Y.T. ( Pretty Young Thing ) '' and `` The Lady in My Life '' . Right before Van Halen 's guitar solo begins , a noise is heard that sounds like somebody knocking at a door . It is reported that the knock was a person walking into Eddie 's recording studio . Another story has claimed that the sound was simply the musician knocking on his own guitar .

Another story has claimed that the sound was simply the musician knocking on his own guitar . The sound , however , is that of Jackson knocking on a drum case , as he is credited in the album 's liner notes . The engineers were shocked during the recording of Van Halen 's solo to discover that the sound of his guitar had caused the monitor speaker in the control room to catch fire , causing one to exclaim , `` This must be really good ! '' The lyrics of `` Beat It '' have been described as a `` sad commentary on human nature '' . The line `` do n't be a macho man '' is said to express Jackson 's dislike of violence , whilst also referring to the childhood abuse he faced at the hands of his father Joseph . The song is played in the key of E \u266d minor at a moderately fast tempo of 138 -- 139 beats per minute . In the song , Jackson 's vocal range is B3 to D5 . Drums on the song were played by Toto co-founder Jeff Porcaro . A remix of `` 2 Bad '' , is featured on Blood on the Dance Floor : HIStory in the Mix containing a sample of `` Beat It '' as well as a rap by John Fort\u00e9 and guitar solo by Wyclef Jean . Release and reception ( edit ) `` The uncredited guitarist who whipped out the fluttering , squealing solo on this ode to macho cowardice was Eddie Van Halen . The aerodynamic metal flight pumped crossover fuel that would boost the success of Thriller -- a gimmick Jackson would flog later with spots from Slash and Carlos Santana . Without the Van Halen precedent , there might have been no collaboration of Run - DMC and Aerosmith on the 1986 rap / rock version of ' Walk This Way ' . '' -- Greg Burk , South Coast Today . `` Beat It '' was released on February 14 , 1983 , following the successful chart performances of `` The Girl Is Mine '' and `` Billie Jean '' . Frank DiLeo , the vice president of Epic Records , convinced Jackson to release `` Beat It '' while `` Billie Jean '' was heading towards No. 1 . Dileo , who would later become the singer 's manager , predicted that both singles would remain in the Top 10 at the same time . `` Billie Jean '' remained atop the Billboard Hot 100 for seven weeks , before being toppled by `` Come On Eileen '' , which stayed at No. 1 for a single week , before Jackson reclaimed the position with `` Beat It '' . `` Billie Jean '' and `` Beat It '' occupied Top 5 positions at the same time , a feat matched by very few artists . The single remained at the top of the Hot 100 for a total of three weeks . The song also charted at No. 1 on the US R&B singles chart and No. 14 on the Billboard Top Tracks chart in the US . Billboard ranked it at the No. 5 song for 1983 . `` Beat It '' also claimed the top spot in Spain",
