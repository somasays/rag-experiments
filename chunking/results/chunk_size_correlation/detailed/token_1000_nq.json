The possibility of challenging the constitutionality of the death penalty became progressively more realistic after the Supreme Court of the United States decided Trop v. Dulles in 1958 , when the court said explicitly for the first time that the Eighth Amendment 's cruel and unusual clause must draw its meaning from the `` evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society '' , rather than from its original meaning .
