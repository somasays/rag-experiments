Fuller elaborated that the original series episode `` Balance of Terror '' , one of his favorites , would be `` a touchstone '' for the season 's story arc . Because of the season 's focus on Klingons and their culture , the producers decided that members of the species would speak their own language with subtitles throughout the show , which Berg said was `` very important for us ... They have their own pride . They have their own interests and talent . It 's a very fascinating culture . '' Noting that the Klingons historically represented the Soviet Union , becoming friendlier with the protagonists of Star Trek as the Cold War ended , Harberts stated that in Discovery they and Starfleet would represent different factions within the modern United States , explaining that `` what we really wanted to do too is understand two differing points of view and really explore it ... making sure they are n't just the enemy . And then finding a way to come together . How do we bring everyone back together ? ( That ) is what season one is all about .

You have to sort of cognitively re-frame or break or deviate from your own point of view to really understand . You have to forget what you knew before . One of the big steps in that journey is how to understand yourself . You have to understand yourself before you can better see others .

The English spelling is based on the pinyin romanization of the two characters as they are pronounced in Standard Mandarin . An older English spelling , Peking , is the postal romanization of the same two characters as they are pronounced in Chinese dialects spoken in the southern port towns first visited by European traders and missionaries . Those dialects preserve the Middle Chinese pronunciation of \u4eac as kjaeng , prior to a phonetic shift in the northern dialects to the modern pronunciation . Although Peking is no longer the common name for the city , some of the city 's older locations and facilities , such as Beijing Capital International Airport , with IATA Code PEK , and Peking University , still use the former romanization .

The history of Hawaii 's economy can be traced through a succession of dominant industries ; sandalwood , whaling , sugarcane , pineapple , the military , tourism and education . Since statehood in 1959 , tourism has been the largest industry , contributing 24.3 % of the gross state product ( GSP ) in 1997 , despite efforts to diversify . The state 's gross output for 2003 was US $47 billion ; per capita income for Hawaii residents in 2014 was US $54,516 . Hawaiian exports include food and clothing . These industries play a small role in the Hawaiian economy , due to the shipping distance to viable markets , such as the West Coast of the contiguous U.S. The state 's food exports include coffee , macadamia nuts , pineapple , livestock , sugarcane and honey . By weight , honey bees may be the state 's most valuable export . According to the Hawaii Agricultural Statistics Service , agricultural sales were US $370.9 million from diversified agriculture , US $100.6 million from pineapple , and US $64.3 million from sugarcane . Hawaii 's relatively consistent climate has attracted the seed industry , which is able to test three generations of crops per year on the islands , compared with one or two on the mainland . Seeds yielded US $264 million in 2012 , supporting 1,400 workers . As of December 2015 , the state 's unemployment rate was 3.2 % . In 2009 , the United States military spent US $12.2 billion in Hawaii , accounting for 18 % of spending in the state for that year . 75,000 United States Department of Defense personnel live in Hawaii .

Because most large cargo ships operate under foreign `` flags of convenience '' such as Liberia , Vanuatu or Papua New Guinea , allowing them to avoid the more stringent , and thus more costly , regulations of developed nations ' ports , the domestic leg of the voyage would be disallowed by the Jones Act . Instead , those cargo ships must proceed directly to the West Coast , where distributors break bulk and transport the Hawaiian - bound , Asian - manufactured goods back across the ocean by U.S. - flagged ships and increasing the length of the voyage by more than 50 % . This highly inefficient system of shipping Hawaii 's consumer cargo comes at a very hefty price for the average Hawaiian citizen , and makes the cost of living in Hawaii much , much higher than it would otherwise be . Hawaiian consumers ultimately bear the expense of transporting goods imposed by the Jones Act . This law makes Hawaii less competitive than West Coast ports as a shopping destination for tourists from countries with much higher taxes like Japan , even though prices for Asian - manufactured goods should be cheaper because Hawaii is much closer than mainland states to Asia . Culture Main article : Culture of the Native Hawaiians The aboriginal culture of Hawaii is Polynesian . Hawaii represents the northernmost extension of the vast Polynesian Triangle of the south and central Pacific Ocean . While traditional Hawaiian culture remains as vestiges in modern Hawaiian society , there are re-enactments of the ceremonies and traditions throughout the islands . Some of these cultural influences , including the popularity ( in greatly modified form ) of l\u016b \u02bbau and hula , are strong enough to affect the wider United States . Cuisine Main article : Cuisine of Hawaii Taro , or in Hawaiian kalo , was one of the primary staples in Ancient Hawaii and remains a central ingredient in Hawaiian gastronomy today . The cuisine of Hawaii is a fusion of many foods brought by immigrants to the Hawaiian Islands , including the earliest Polynesians and Native Hawaiian cuisine , and American , Chinese , Filipino , Japanese , Korean , Polynesian and Portuguese origins .

Hawaii home values were the highest of all states , including California with a median home value of US $211,500 . Research from the National Association of Realtors places the 2010 median sale price of a single family home in Honolulu , Hawaii , at US $607,600 and the U.S. median sales price at US $173,200 . The sale price of single family homes in Hawaii was the highest of any U.S. city in 2010 , just above that of the Silicon Valley area of California ( US $602,000 ) . Hawaii 's very high cost of living is the result of several interwoven factors of the global economy in addition to domestic U.S. government trade policy . Like other regions with desirable weather throughout the year , such as areas of California , Arizona and Florida , Hawaii 's residents can be considered to be subject to a `` Sunshine tax '' . This situation is further exacerbated by the natural factors of geography and world distribution that lead to higher prices for goods due to increased shipping costs , a problem which many island states and territories suffer from as well . The situation is compounded even further by what could possibly be the single largest contributor to the high costs of living in Hawaii , a U.S. trade law known as the Jones Act , or the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 . This trade regulation prohibits any foreign - flagged ships from carrying cargo between two American ports -- a practice known as cabotage . Most consumer goods in the United States are manufactured by outsourced labor in East Asia , then transported by container ships to ports on the U.S. mainland , and Hawaii also receives the same goods . Being located in the central Pacific Ocean , right between major Pacific shipping lanes , it would be very economical to unload Hawaiian - bound goods in Honolulu , before continuing on to the mainland .

( April 2015 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) Cover of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles # 1 ( May 1984 ) The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles first appeared in an American comic book published by Mirage Studios in 1984 in Dover , New Hampshire . The concept arose from a humorous drawing sketched out by Eastman during a casual evening of brainstorming and bad television with Laird . Using money from a tax refund , together with a loan from Eastman 's uncle , the young artists self - published a single - issue comic intended to parody four of the most popular comics of the early 1980s : Marvel Comics ' Daredevil and New Mutants , Dave Sim 's Cerebus , and Frank Miller 's Ronin . The TMNT comic book series has been published in various incarnations by various comic book companies since 1984 . The Turtles started their rise to mainstream success when a licensing agent , Mark Freedman , sought out Eastman and Laird to propose wider merchandising opportunities for the franchise . In",

The show places a much stronger emphasis on humor than the comics do . Here , the Ninja Turtles are portrayed as four wise - cracking , pizza - obsessed superheroes that fight the forces of evil from their sewer hideout , and they make their first appearance in masks color - coded to each turtle , where previously they had all worn red . The cast included new and different characters , such as Bebop and Rocksteady and the Neutrinos . Original characters such as Splinter , Shredder , and the Foot Soldiers stayed true to the comics in appearance and alignment only . Instead of being Hamato Yoshi 's mutated pet rat , Splinter was a mutated Hamato himself . The Foot Soldiers changed from human ninjas to an endless supply of robotic grunts , allowing large numbers of them to be destroyed without anyone dying ( this was a very important decision in terms of the show 's child audience ; excessive violence would have alienated parents of children , the show 's target demographic ) . Krang , one of the series ' most memorable villains , was inspired by the design of the Utrom , a benign alien race from the Mirage comics . The animated Krang , however , was instead an evil warlord from Dimension X . Baxter Stockman , whose race was changed from black to white either due to apprehension toward depicting a villainous African American character in a children 's cartoon or that for Shredder to boss around a black Stockman would be perceived as racist . Either way , Stockman was rewritten as a shy and meek lackey to Shredder , later mutating into an anthropomorphic housefly . During the final two seasons of the show , to combat the rising popularity of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers , the lead villain switched to Lord Dregg , an evil alien overlord bent on world conquest by trying to distract the public into believing that the Turtles were the enemy instead of himself .

Once the product started selling , the show got syndicated and picked up and backed by Group W , which funded the next round of animation . The show then went network , on CBS . Accompanied by the popular Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 1987 TV series , and the subsequent action figure line , Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles became a mainstream success . At the height of the frenzy , in the late 1980s and early 1990s , the Turtles ' likenesses could be found on a wide range of children 's merchandise , from Pez dispensers to skateboards , breakfast cereal , video games , school supplies , linens , towels , cameras , and toy shaving kits . While the animated TV series , which lasted for 10 seasons until 1996 , was more light - hearted , the comic - book series continued in a much darker and grittier tone . In 1990 , a live - action feature film was released , with the Turtles and Splinter being portrayed by actors in partially animatronic suits created by Jim Henson 's Creature Shop . The film became one of the most successful independent films and spawned two sequels , as well as inspiring a three - dimensional animated film set in the same continuity , which was released in 2007 under the title TMNT . After the end of the cartoon series , a live - action series in the vein of the films was created in 1997 in conjunction with Saban Entertainment . The series was called Ninja Turtles : The Next Mutation and introduced a fifth , female turtle called Venus de Milo . However , the series was largely unsuccessful and was canceled after one season .

The European nations declared war on one another in 1756 following months of localized conflict , escalating the war from a regional affair into an intercontinental conflict . The name French and Indian War is used mainly in the United States . It refers to the two main enemies of the British colonists : the royal French forces and the various American Indian forces allied with them . The British colonists were supported at various times by the Iroquois , Catawba , and Cherokee , and the French colonists were supported by Wabanaki Confederacy members Abenaki and Mi'kmaq , and Algonquin , Lenape , Ojibwa , Ottawa , Shawnee , and Wyandot . British and other European historians use the term the Seven Years ' War , as do English - speaking Canadians . French Canadians call it La guerre de la Conqu\u00eate ( the War of the Conquest ) or ( rarely ) the Fourth Intercolonial War . Fighting took place primarily along the frontiers between New France and the British colonies , from Virginia in the south to Newfoundland in the north . It began with a dispute over control of the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers called the Forks of the Ohio , and the site of the French Fort Duquesne within present - day Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . The dispute erupted into violence in the Battle of Jumonville Glen in May 1754 , during which Virginia militiamen under the command of 22 - year - old George Washington ambushed a French patrol . In 1755 , six colonial governors in North America met with General Edward Braddock , the newly arrived British Army commander , and planned a four - way attack on the French . None succeeded , and the main effort by Braddock proved a disaster ; he lost the Battle of the Monongahela on July 9 , 1755 and died a few days later . British operations failed in the frontier areas of Pennsylvania and New York during 1755 -- 57 due to a combination of poor management , internal divisions , effective Canadian scouts , French regular forces , and Indian warrior allies .

A 2008 survey of secondary books read by students between grades 9 -- 12 in the U.S. indicates the novel is the most widely read book in these grades . A 1991 survey by the Book of the Month Club and the Library of Congress Center for the Book found that To Kill a Mockingbird was rated behind only the Bible in books that are `` most often cited as making a difference '' . It is considered by some to be the `` Great American Novel '' . The 50th anniversary of the novel 's release was met with celebrations and reflections on its impact .

The plot and characters are loosely based on Lee 's observations of her family , her neighbors and an event that occurred near her hometown of Monroeville , Alabama , in 1936 , when she was 10 years old . The story is told by the six - year - old Jean Louise Finch . The novel is renowned for its warmth and humor , despite dealing with the serious issues of rape and racial inequality . The narrator 's father , Atticus Finch , has served as a moral hero for many readers and as a model of integrity for lawyers . One critic explains the novel 's impact by writing , `` In the twentieth century , To Kill a Mockingbird is probably the most widely read book dealing with race in America , and its protagonist , Atticus Finch , the most enduring fictional image of racial heroism . '' As a Southern Gothic novel and a Bildungsroman , the primary themes of To Kill a Mockingbird involve racial injustice and the destruction of innocence . Scholars have noted that Lee also addresses issues of class , courage , compassion , and gender roles in the American Deep South . The book is widely taught in schools in the United States with lessons that emphasize tolerance and decry prejudice .

Both Ebert and Siskel called the win for Christopher Walken receiving the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor .

Throughout its six - year run , the show received contributions from various producers , writers , and directors , perhaps most significantly from Michael Patrick King . Set and filmed in New York City and based on the 1997 book of the same name by Candace Bushnell , the show follows the lives of a group of four women -- three in their mid-thirties and one in her forties -- who , despite their different natures and ever - changing sex lives , remain inseparable and confide in each other . Starring Sarah Jessica Parker ( as Carrie Bradshaw ) , Kim Cattrall ( as Samantha Jones ) , Kristin Davis ( as Charlotte York ) , and Cynthia Nixon ( as Miranda Hobbes ) , the quirky series had multiple continuing storylines that tackled relevant and modern social issues such as sexuality , safe sex , promiscuity , and femininity , while exploring the difference between friendships and romantic relationships . The deliberate omission of the better part of the early lives of the four women was the writers ' way of exploring social life -- from sex to relationships -- through each of their four very different , individual perspectives . The series received both acclaim and criticism for its subjects and characters , and is credited with helping jump - start HBO . It spawned two feature films , Sex and the City ( 2008 ) and its sequel Sex and the City 2 ( 2010 ) , and a prequel series by The CW , The Carrie Diaries . It also won seven of its 54 Emmy Award nominations , eight of its 24 Golden Globe Award nominations , and three of its 11 Screen Actors Guild Award nominations .

The battles were fought on April 19 , 1775 in Middlesex County , Province of Massachusetts Bay , within the towns of Lexington , Concord , Lincoln , Menotomy ( present - day Arlington ) , and Cambridge . They marked the outbreak of armed conflict between the Kingdom of Great Britain and its thirteen colonies in America . In late 1774 , Colonial leaders adopted the Suffolk Resolves in resistance to the alterations made to the Massachusetts colonial government by the British parliament following the Boston Tea Party . The colonial assembly responded by forming a Patriot provisional government known as the Massachusetts Provincial Congress and calling for local militias to train for possible hostilities . The Colonial government exercised effective control of the colony outside of British - controlled Boston . In response , the British government in February 1775 declared Massachusetts to be in a state of rebellion . About 700 British Army regulars in Boston , under Lieutenant Colonel Francis Smith , were given secret orders to capture and destroy Colonial military supplies reportedly stored by the Massachusetts militia at Concord . Through effective intelligence gathering , Patriot leaders had received word weeks before the expedition that their supplies might be at risk and had moved most of them to other locations . On the night before the battle , warning of the British expedition had been rapidly sent from Boston to militias in the area by several riders , including Paul Revere , with information about British plans . The initial mode of the Army 's arrival by water was signaled from the Old North Church in Boston to Charleston using lanterns to communicate `` one if by land , two if by sea '' . The first shots were fired just as the sun was rising at Lexington . Eight militiamen were killed , including Ensign Robert Munroe , their ranking officer . The British suffered only one casualty . The militia were outnumbered and fell back , and the regulars proceeded on to Concord , where they",

They carried their haversacks ( food bags ) , canteens , muskets , and accoutrements , and marched off in wet , muddy shoes and soggy uniforms . As they marched through Menotomy , sounds of the colonial alarms throughout the countryside caused the few officers who were aware of their mission to realize they had lost the element of surprise . At about 3 am , Colonel Smith sent Major Pitcairn ahead with six companies of light infantry under orders to quick march to Concord .

As the regulars ' advance guard under Pitcairn entered Lexington at sunrise on April 19 , 1775 , about 80 Lexington militiamen emerged from Buckman Tavern and stood in ranks on the village common watching them , and between 40 and 100 spectators watched from along the side of the road . Their leader was Captain John Parker , a veteran of the French and Indian War , who was suffering from tuberculosis and was at times difficult to hear . Of the militiamen who lined up , nine had the surname Harrington , seven Munroe ( including the company 's orderly sergeant , William Munroe ) , four Parker , three Tidd , three Locke , and three Reed ; fully one quarter of them were related to Captain Parker in some way .

Most traditional ceramic products were made from clay ( or clay mixed with other materials ) , shaped and subjected to heat , and tableware and decorative ceramics are generally still made this way . In modern ceramic engineering usage , ceramics is the art and science of making objects from inorganic , non-metallic materials by the action of heat . It excludes glass and mosaic made from glass tesserae . There is a long history of ceramic art in almost all developed cultures , and often ceramic objects are all the artistic evidence left from vanished cultures , like that of the Nok in Africa over 2,000 years ago . Cultures especially noted for ceramics include the Chinese , Cretan , Greek , Persian , Mayan , Japanese , and Korean cultures , as well as the modern Western cultures .

United Kingdom ( edit ) The relevant EU directives banning tobacco advertising apply within the United Kingdom , in addition to UK laws restricting tobacco advertising . Surreal Benson & Hedges poster at Victoria Station , London , c. 1978 The first calls to restrict advertising came in 1962 from the Royal College of Physicians , who highlighted the health problems and recommended stricter laws on the sale and advertising of tobacco products . In 1971 , an agreement between the government and the tobacco industry saw the inclusion of health warnings on all cigarette packets . All television commercials for cigarettes were banned on 1 August 1965 , although commercials for loose tobacco and cigars continued until 1991 . Non-television advertising campaigns were still allowed in the UK but came under stricter guidelines in 1986 , which in particular , prevented adverts from actually showing a person smoking . The tobacco producers responded with increasingly indirect and abstract campaigns , among which those of Benson & Hedges and Silk Cut became particularly recognisable . Until about the mid-1990s , many corner shops , newsagents and off licences had on their shop signs prominent branding by cigarette brands such as Benson & Hedges , Silk Cut , Regal etc. until the practice was outlawed . As part of their 1997 general election campaign , the Labour Party led by Tony Blair pledged to ban all advertising of tobacco products . When it was not included in their manifesto , it was introduced by Liberal Democrat Peer Tim Clement - Jones and was passed as the Tobacco Advertising and Promotion Act 2002 , which banned most remaining forms of advertising according to the following timescale : Date What was banned 14 February 2003 General advertising 14 May 2003 Promotions 30 July 2003 Sponsorship of sporting events within the UK May 2004 Particular advertisements in tobacconists 21 December 2004 Large adverts in shops , pubs and clubs 31 July 2005 Sponsorship of excepted global events ; brandsharing It was banned in Scotland by the Scottish Executive in 2001 .

Apart from an Anglophile element urging early support for the British , American public opinion reflected that of the president : the sentiment for neutrality was particularly strong among Irish Americans , German Americans and Scandinavian Americans , as well as among church leaders and among women in general . On the other hand , even before World War I had broken out , American opinion had been more negative toward Germany than towards any other country in Europe . Over time , especially after reports of atrocities in Belgium in 1914 and following the sinking of the passenger liner RMS Lusitania in 1915 , the American people increasingly came to see Germany as the aggressor in Europe . As U.S. president , it was Wilson who made the key policy decisions over foreign affairs : while the country was at peace , the domestic economy ran on a laissez - faire basis , with American banks making huge loans to Britain and France -- funds that were in large part used to buy munitions , raw materials , and food from across the Atlantic . Until 1917 , Wilson made minimal preparations for a land war and kept the United States Army on a small peacetime footing , despite increasing demands for enhanced preparedness . He did however expand the United States Navy . In 1917 , with Russia experiencing political upheaval following widespread disillusionment there over the war , and with Britain and France low on credit , Germany appeared to have the upper hand in Europe , while Germany 's ally , the Ottoman Empire , clung stubbornly to its possessions in the Middle East . In the same year , Germany decided to resume unrestricted submarine warfare against any vessel approaching British waters ; this attempt to starve Britain into surrender was balanced against the knowledge that it would almost certainly bring the United States into the war . Germany also made a secret offer to help Mexico regain territories lost in the Mexican -- American War in an encoded telegram known as the Zimmermann Telegram , which was intercepted by British Intelligence . Publication of that communique outraged Americans just as German U-boats started sinking American merchant ships in the North Atlantic . Wilson then",

On April 22 , the German Imperial Embassy warned U.S. citizens against boarding vessels to Britain , which would have to face German attack . On May 7 , Germany torpedoed the British passenger liner RMS Lusitania , sinking her . This act of aggression caused the loss of 1,198 civilian lives , including 128 Americans . The sinking of a large , unarmed passenger ship , combined with the previous stories of atrocities in Belgium , shocked Americans and turned public opinion hostile to Germany , although not yet to the point of war . Wilson issued a warning to Germany that it would face `` strict accountability '' if it sank more neutral U.S. passenger ships . Berlin acquiesced , ordering its submarines to avoid passenger ships . By January 1917 , however , Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg and General Erich Ludendorff decided that an unrestricted submarine blockade was the only way to achieve a decisive victory . They demanded that Kaiser Wilhelm order unrestricted submarine warfare be resumed . Germany knew this decision meant war with the United States , but they gambled that they could win before America 's potential strength could be mobilized . However , they overestimated how many ships they could sink and thus the extent Britain would be weakened . Finally , they did not foresee that convoys could and would be used to defeat their efforts . They believed that the United States was so weak militarily that it could not be a factor on the Western Front for more than a year . The civilian government in Berlin objected , but the Kaiser sided with his military . Business considerations ( edit ) The beginning of war in Europe coincided with the end of the Recession of 1913 -- 1914 in America . Exports to belligerent nations rose rapidly over the first four years of the War from $824.8 million in 1913 to $2.25 billion in 1917 . Loans from American financial institutions to the Allied nations in Europe also increased dramatically over the same period . Economic activity towards the end of this period boomed as government resources aided the production of the private sector . Between 1914 and 1917 , industrial production increased 32 % and GNP increased by almost 20 % . The improvements to industrial production in the United States outlasted the war .

Declaration of war ( edit ) Germany ( edit ) On April 2 , 1917 , Wilson asked a special joint session of Congress to declare war on the German Empire , stating , `` We have no selfish ends to serve '' . To make the conflict seem like a better idea , he painted the conflict idealistically , stating that the war would `` make the world safe for democracy '' and later that it would be a `` war to end war '' . The United States had a moral responsibility to enter the war , Wilson proclaimed . The future of the world was being determined on the battlefield , and American national interest demanded a voice . Wilson 's definition of the situation won wide acclaim , and , indeed , has shaped America 's role in world and military affairs ever since . Wilson believed that if the Central Powers won , the consequences would be bad for the United States . Germany would have dominated the continent and perhaps would gain control of the seas as well . Latin America could well have fallen under Berlin 's control . The dream of spreading democracy , liberalism , and independence would have been shattered . On the other hand , if the Allies had won without help , there was a danger they would carve up the world without regard to American commercial interests . They were already planning to use government subsidies , tariff walls , and controlled markets to counter the competition posed by American businessmen . The solution was a third route , a `` peace without victory '' , according to Wilson . On April 6 , 1917 , Congress declared war . In the Senate , the resolution passed 82 to 6 , with Senators Harry Lane , William J. Stone , James Vardaman , Asle Gronna , Robert M. La Follette , Sr. , and George W. Norris voting against it . In the House , the declaration passed 373 to 50 , with Claude Kitchin , a senior Democrat , notably opposing it . Another opponent was Jeannette Rankin , who alone voted against entry into both World War I and World War II . Nearly all of the opposition came from the West and the Midwest .

A first trailer for the series would be released on November 26 , 2015 . Unlike most TV series that film their episodes in order , Slasher , under the direction of Craig David Wallace , was shot as if it were a `` super-sized '' movie : Scenes from multiple episodes were shot at the same time , with the availability of locations and cast being factored in . The out - of - order schedule allowed the actors to know of their characters ' fates , especially those who had to film their death scenes one day but return later to film earlier scenes as necessary . As an example of this , Martin cited Mark Ghanim\u00e9 's first day on set , when his character , Justin Faysal , was laid out in a casket for a scene early in Slasher 's third episode ( Justin 's death , which took place in Episode 2 , would be filmed later on ) .

Work was also strongly researched in the US on nuclear marine propulsion , with a test reactor being developed by 1953 ( eventually , the USS Nautilus , the first nuclear - powered submarine , would launch in 1955 ) . In 1953 , US President Dwight Eisenhower gave his `` Atoms for Peace '' speech at the United Nations , emphasizing the need to develop `` peaceful '' uses of nuclear power quickly . This was followed by the 1954 Amendments to the Atomic Energy Act which allowed rapid declassification of US reactor technology and encouraged development by the private sector . Early years On June 27 , 1954 , the USSR 's Obninsk Nuclear Power Plant became the world 's first nuclear power plant to generate electricity for a power grid , and produced around 5 megawatts of electric power . Later in 1954 , Lewis Strauss , then chairman of the United States Atomic Energy Commission ( U.S. AEC , forerunner of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the United States Department of Energy ) spoke of electricity in the future being `` too cheap to meter '' . Strauss was very likely referring to hydrogen fusion -- which was secretly being developed as part of Project Sherwood at the time -- but Strauss 's statement was interpreted as a promise of very cheap energy from nuclear fission . The U.S. AEC itself had issued far more realistic testimony regarding nuclear fission to the U.S. Congress only months before , projecting that `` costs can be brought down ...

It initially aired on Fox from June 11 , 2002 to April 7 , 2016 for 15 seasons . On March 11 , 2018 , the 16th season made its debut on ABC . It started as an addition to the Idols format that was based on Pop Idol from British television , and became one of the most successful shows in the history of American television . The concept of the series involves discovering recording stars from unsigned singing talents , with the winner determined by American viewers using phones , Internet , and SMS text voting . The winners of the first fifteen seasons , as chosen by viewers , are Kelly Clarkson , Ruben Studdard , Fantasia , Carrie Underwood , Taylor Hicks , Jordin Sparks , David Cook , Kris Allen , Lee DeWyze , Scotty McCreery , Phillip Phillips , Candice Glover , Caleb Johnson , Nick Fradiani , and Trent Harmon . American Idol employs a panel of vocal judges who critique the contestants ' performances . The original judges , for seasons one through eight , were record producer and music manager Randy Jackson , singer and choreographer Paula Abdul , and music executive and manager Simon Cowell . The judging panel for seasons 13 , 14 , and 15 on Fox consisted of singers Keith Urban , Jennifer Lopez , and Harry Connick , Jr .

Brain tissue consumes a large amount of energy in proportion to its volume , so large brains place severe metabolic demands on animals . The need to limit body weight in order , for example , to fly , has apparently led to selection for a reduction of brain size in some species , such as bats . Most of the brain 's energy consumption goes into sustaining the electric charge ( membrane potential ) of neurons . Most vertebrate species devote between 2 % and 8 % of basal metabolism to the brain . In primates , however , the percentage is much higher -- in humans it rises to 20 -- 25 % . The energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time , but active regions of the cerebral cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions ; this forms the basis for the functional brain imaging methods PET , fMRI , and NIRS . The brain typically gets most of its energy from oxygen - dependent metabolism of glucose ( i.e. , blood sugar ) , but ketones provide a major alternative source , together with contributions from medium chain fatty acids ( caprylic and heptanoic acids ) , lactate , acetate , and possibly amino acids . Functions Model of a neural circuit in the cerebellum , as proposed by James S. Albus . Information from the sense organs is collected in the brain . There it is used to determine what actions the organism is to take . The brain processes the raw data to extract information about the structure of the environment . Next it combines the processed information with information about the current needs of the animal and with memory of past circumstances . Finally , on the basis of the results , it generates motor response patterns . These signal - processing tasks require intricate interplay between a variety of functional subsystems . The function of the brain is to provide coherent control over the actions of an animal . A centralized brain allows groups of muscles to be co-activated in complex patterns ; it also allows stimuli impinging on one part of the body to evoke responses in other parts , and it can prevent different parts of the body from acting at cross-purposes to each other .

Serotonin , for example -- the primary target of antidepressant drugs and many dietary aids -- comes exclusively from a small brainstem area called the raphe nuclei . Norepinephrine , which is involved in arousal , comes exclusively from a nearby small area called the locus coeruleus . Other neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine and dopamine have multiple sources in the brain , but are not as ubiquitously distributed as glutamate and GABA . Electrical activity Brain electrical activity recorded from a human patient during an epileptic seizure . As a side effect of the electrochemical processes used by neurons for signaling , brain tissue generates electric fields when it is active . When large numbers of neurons show synchronized activity , the electric fields that they generate can be large enough to detect outside the skull , using electroencephalography ( EEG ) or magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) . EEG recordings , along with recordings made from electrodes implanted inside the brains of animals such as rats , show that the brain of a living animal is constantly active , even during sleep . Each part of the brain shows a mixture of rhythmic and nonrhythmic activity , which may vary according to behavioral state . In mammals , the cerebral cortex tends to show large slow delta waves during sleep , faster alpha waves when the animal is awake but inattentive , and chaotic - looking irregular activity when the animal is actively engaged in a task . During an epileptic seizure , the brain 's inhibitory control mechanisms fail to function and electrical activity rises to pathological levels , producing EEG traces that show large wave and spike patterns not seen in a healthy brain . Relating these population - level patterns to the computational functions of individual neurons is a major focus of current research in neurophysiology .

Built in Belfast , Ireland , in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ( as it was then known ) , the RMS Titanic was the second of the three Olympic - class ocean liners -- the first was the RMS Olympic and the third was the HMHS Britannic . They were by far the largest vessels of the British shipping company White Star Line 's fleet , which comprised 29 steamers and tenders in 1912 . The three ships had their genesis in a discussion in mid-1907 between the White Star Line 's chairman , J. Bruce Ismay , and the American financier J.P. Morgan , who controlled the White Star Line 's parent corporation , the International Mercantile Marine Co . ( IMM ) . The White Star Line faced an increasing challenge from its main rivals Cunard , which had recently launched the Lusitania and the Mauretania -- the fastest passenger ships then in service -- and the German lines Hamburg America and Norddeutscher Lloyd . Ismay preferred to compete on size rather than speed and proposed to commission a new class of liners that would be larger than anything that had gone before as well as being the last word in comfort and luxury . The company sought an upgrade in their fleet primarily in response to the Cunard giants but also to replace their oldest pair of passenger ships still in service , being the SS Teutonic of 1889 and SS Majestic of 1890 . Teutonic was replaced by Olympic while Majestic was replaced by Titanic . Majestic would be brought back into her old spot on White Star 's New York service after Titanic 's loss . The",

There were an estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard the ship , and more than 1,500 died , making it one of the deadliest commercial peacetime maritime disasters in modern history .

The possibility of challenging the constitutionality of the death penalty became progressively more realistic after the Supreme Court of the United States decided Trop v. Dulles in 1958 , when the court said explicitly for the first time that the Eighth Amendment 's cruel and unusual clause must draw its meaning from the `` evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society '' , rather than from its original meaning . Also in the 1932 case Powell v. Alabama , the court made the first step of what would be later be called `` death is different '' jurisprudence , when it held that any indigent defendant was entitled to a court - appointed attorney in capital cases - a right that was only later extended to non-capital defendants in 1963 , with Gideon v. Wainwright . Capital punishment suspended ( 1972 ) ( edit ) Further information : Furman v. Georgia Executions in the United States since 1960 In Furman v. Georgia , the U.S. Supreme Court considered a group of consolidated cases . The lead case involved an individual convicted under Georgia 's death penalty statute , which featured a `` unitary trial '' procedure in which the jury was asked to return a verdict of guilt or innocence and , simultaneously , determine whether the defendant would be punished by death or life imprisonment . The last pre-Furman execution was that of Luis Monge on June 2 , 1967 . In a 5 - 4 decision , the Supreme Court struck down the impositions of the death penalty in each of the consolidated cases as unconstitutional in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution . The Supreme Court has never ruled the death penalty to be per se unconstitutional . The five justices in the majority did not produce a common opinion or rationale for their decision , however , and agreed only on a short statement announcing the result . The narrowest opinions , those of Byron White and Potter Stewart , expressed generalized concerns about the inconsistent application of the death penalty across a variety of cases , but did not exclude the possibility of a constitutional",

Council Bluffs had several advantages : It was well north of the Civil War fighting in Missouri ; it was the shortest route to South Pass in the Rockies in Wyoming ; and it would follow a fertile river that would encourage settlement . Durant had hired Lincoln in 1857 when he was an attorney to represent him in a business matter about a bridge over the Missouri . Now Lincoln was responsible for choosing the eastern terminus , and he relied on Durant 's counsel .

Whitney traveled widely to solicit support from businessmen and politicians , printed maps and pamphlets , and submitted several proposals to Congress , all at his own expense .

In 1847 he submitted to the U.S. Congress a `` Proposal for a Charter to Build a Railroad from Lake Michigan to the Pacific Ocean '' , seeking a congressional charter to support his idea . Preliminary exploration ( edit ) The official poster announcing the Pacific Railroad 's grand opening . Congress agreed to support the idea . Under the direction of the Department of War , the Pacific Railroad Surveys were conducted from 1853 through 1855 . These included an extensive series of expeditions of the American West seeking possible routes . A report on the explorations described alternative routes and included an immense amount of information about the American West , covering at least 400,000 sq mi ( 1,000,000 km ) . It included the region 's natural history and illustrations of reptiles , amphibians , birds , and mammals .

This indicates that one or more supernovae must have occurred near the location where the Sun formed . A shock wave from a nearby supernova would have triggered the formation of the Sun by compressing the matter within the molecular cloud and causing certain regions to collapse under their own gravity . As one fragment of the cloud collapsed it also began to rotate because of conservation of angular momentum and heat up with the increasing pressure . Much of the mass became concentrated in the center , whereas the rest flattened out into a disk that would become the planets and other Solar System bodies . Gravity and pressure within the core of the cloud generated a lot of heat as it accreted more matter from the surrounding disk , eventually triggering nuclear fusion . Thus , the Sun was born . Main sequence Evolution of the Sun 's luminosity , radius and effective temperature compared to the present Sun . After Ribas ( 2010 ) The Sun is about halfway through its main - sequence stage , during which nuclear fusion reactions in its core fuse hydrogen into helium . Each second , more than four million tonnes of matter are converted into energy within the Sun 's core , producing neutrinos and solar radiation . At this rate , the Sun has so far converted around 100 times the mass of Earth into energy , about 0.03 % of the total mass of the Sun . The Sun will spend a total of approximately 10 billion years as a main - sequence star . The Sun is gradually becoming hotter during its time on the main sequence , because the helium atoms in the core occupy less volume than the hydrogen atoms that were fused . The core is therefore shrinking , allowing the outer layers of the Sun to move closer to the centre and experience a stronger gravitational force , according to the inverse - square law . This stronger force increases the pressure on the core , which is resisted by a gradual increase in the rate at which fusion occurs . This process speeds up as the core gradually becomes denser .

The Sun then shrinks to around 10 times its current size and 50 times the luminosity , with a temperature a little lower than today . It will then have reached the red clump or horizontal branch , but a star of the Sun 's mass does not evolve blueward along the horizontal branch . Instead , it just becomes moderately larger and more luminous over about 100 million years as it continues to burn helium in the core . When the helium is exhausted , the Sun will repeat the expansion it followed when the hydrogen in the core was exhausted , except that this time it all happens faster , and the Sun becomes larger and more luminous . This is the asymptotic - giant - branch phase , and the Sun is alternately burning hydrogen in a shell or helium in a deeper shell . After about 20 million years on the early asymptotic giant branch , the Sun becomes increasingly unstable , with rapid mass loss and thermal pulses that increase the size and luminosity for a few hundred years every 100,000 years or so .

Fox left the Broncos with a . 719 winning percentage in his four seasons as the Broncos ' head coach -- the highest in franchise history . One week later , the Broncos hired Gary Kubiak as the team 's 15th head coach . Kubiak served as a backup quarterback to executive vice president / general manager John Elway from 1983 -- 1991 , as well as the Broncos ' offensive coordinator from 1995 -- 2005 . Shortly after Kubiak became head coach , the Broncos underwent numerous changes to their coaching staff , including the hiring of defensive coordinator Wade Phillips , under whom the Broncos ' defense ranked No. 1 in the NFL during the 2015 season .

Initially , the Methodists merely sought reform within the Church of England ( Anglicanism ) , but the movement gradually departed from that Church . George Whitefield 's preference for extemporaneous prayer rather than the fixed forms of prayer in the BCP , in addition to his insistence on the necessity of the New Birth , set him at odds with Anglican clergy . As Methodist societies multiplied , and elements of an ecclesiastical system were , one after another , adopted , the breach between John Wesley and the Church of England gradually widened . In 1784 , Wesley responded to the shortage of priests in the American colonies due to the American Revolutionary War by ordaining preachers for America with power to administer the sacraments . This was a major reason for Methodism 's final split from the Church of England after Wesley 's death . This split created a separate , eventually worldwide , group of church denominations . With regard to the position of Methodism within Christendom , `` John Wesley once noted that what God had achieved in the development of Methodism was no mere human endeavor but the work of God .

George Whitefield and John 's brother Charles Wesley were also significant early leaders in the movement . It originated as a revival within the 18th century Church of England and became a separate denomination after Wesley 's death . The movement spread throughout the British Empire , the United States , and beyond because of vigorous missionary work , today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide . Wesley 's theology focused on sanctification and the effect of faith on the character of a Christian . Distinguishing Methodist doctrines include an assurance of salvation , imparted righteousness , the possibility of perfection in love , the works of piety , and the primacy of Scripture . Most Methodists teach that Jesus Christ , the Son of God , died for all of humanity and that salvation is available for all ; in theology , this view is known as Arminianism .

Early Methodism experienced a radical and spiritual phase that allowed women authority in church leadership . The role of the woman preacher emerged from the sense that the home should be a place of community care and should foster personal growth . Methodist women formed a community that cared for the vulnerable , extending the role of mothering beyond physical care . Women were encouraged to testify their faith . However the centrality of women 's role sharply diminished after 1790 as Methodist churches became more structured and more male dominated . The Wesleyan Education Committee , which existed from 1838 to 1902 , has documented the Methodist Church 's involvement in the education of children . At first most effort was placed in creating Sunday Schools but in 1836 the British Methodist Conference gave its blessing to the creation of `` Weekday schools '' . Methodism spread throughout the British Empire and , mostly through Whitefield 's preaching during what historians call the First Great Awakening , in colonial America .

Armstrong became the first human to step onto the lunar surface six hours after landing on July 21 at 02 : 56 : 15 UTC ; Aldrin joined him about 20 minutes later . They spent about two and a quarter hours together outside the spacecraft , and collected 47.5 pounds ( 21.5 kg ) of lunar material to bring back to Earth . Michael Collins piloted the command module Columbia alone in lunar orbit while they were on the Moon 's surface . Armstrong and Aldrin spent just under a day on the lunar surface before rejoining Columbia in lunar orbit . Apollo 11 was launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island , Florida , on July 16 at 9 : 32 am EDT ( 13 : 32 UTC ) and was the fifth manned mission of NASA 's Apollo program . The Apollo spacecraft had three parts : a command module ( CM ) with a cabin for the three astronauts , and the only part that returned to Earth ; a service module ( SM ) , which supported the command module with propulsion , electrical power , oxygen , and water ; and a lunar module ( LM ) that had two stages -- a descent stage for landing on the Moon , and an ascent stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit . After being sent to the Moon by the Saturn V 's third stage , the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit . Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the lunar module Eagle and landed in the Sea of Tranquility . They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface . The astronauts used Eagle 's upper stage to lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module . They jettisoned Eagle before they performed the maneuvers that blasted them out of lunar orbit on a trajectory back to Earth . They returned to Earth and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 after more than eight days in space . The landing was broadcast on live TV to a worldwide audience . Armstrong stepped onto the lunar surface and described the event as `` one small step for ( a",

After describing the surface dust as `` very fine - grained '' and `` almost like a powder , '' six and a half hours after landing , Armstrong stepped off Eagle 's footpad and declared , `` That 's one small step for ( a ) man , one giant leap for mankind . '' Armstrong intended to say `` That 's one small step for a man '' , but the word `` a '' is not audible in the transmission , and thus was not initially reported by most observers of the live broadcast . When later asked about his quote , Armstrong said he believed he said `` for a man '' , and subsequent printed versions of the quote included the `` a '' in square brackets . One explanation for the absence may be that his accent caused him to slur the words `` for a '' together ; another is the intermittent nature of the audio and video links to Earth , partly because of storms near Parkes Observatory . More recent digital analysis of the tape claims to reveal the `` a '' may have been spoken but obscured by static . That 's one small step ... Problems playing this file ? See media help . About seven minutes after stepping onto the Moon 's surface , Armstrong collected a contingency soil sample using a sample bag on a stick . He then folded the bag and tucked it into a pocket on his right thigh . This was to guarantee there would be some lunar soil brought back in case an emergency required the astronauts to abandon the EVA and return to the LM . Twelve minutes after the contingency sample was collected , Aldrin joined Armstrong on the surface , and described the view with the simple phrase , `` Magnificent desolation .

'' Jermaine Jackson has suggested the inspiration of `` Beat It '' and its video came from the Jackson family experiencing gang activity in Gary , Indiana . `` From our front window , we witnessed , about three bad rumbles between rival gangs . '' Upon hearing the first recorded vocals , Jones stated that it was exactly what he was looking for . The song begins with seven distinct synthesizer notes played on the Synclavier digital synthesizer , with Tom Bahler credited for the Synclavier performance on the song . The intro is taken note for note from a demo LP released the year before , called `` The Incredible Sounds of Synclavier II '' first published in 1981 by Denny Jaeger Creative Services , Inc and sold by New England Digital , makers of the Synclavier . Eddie Van Halen , lead guitarist of hard rock band Van Halen , was asked to add a guitar solo . When initially contacted by Jones , Van Halen thought he was receiving a prank call . Having established that the call was genuine , Van Halen borrowed an amplifier from guitarist Allan Holdsworth and recorded his guitar solo free of any charge . `` I did it as a favor '' , the musician later said . `` I was a complete fool , according to the rest of the band , our manager and everyone else . I was not used . I knew what I was doing -- I do n't do something unless I want to do it . '' Van Halen recorded his contribution following Jones and Jackson arriving at the guitarist 's house with a `` skeleton version '' of the song . Fellow guitarist Steve Lukather recalled , `` Initially , we rocked it out as Eddie had played a good solo -- but Quincy thought it was too tough .

It is reported that the knock was a person walking into Eddie 's recording studio . Another story has claimed that the sound was simply the musician knocking on his own guitar . The sound , however , is that of Jackson knocking on a drum case , as he is credited in the album 's liner notes . The engineers were shocked during the recording of Van Halen 's solo to discover that the sound of his guitar had caused the monitor speaker in the control room to catch fire , causing one to exclaim , `` This must be really good ! '' The lyrics of `` Beat It '' have been described as a `` sad commentary on human nature '' . The line `` do n't be a macho man '' is said to express Jackson 's dislike of violence , whilst also referring to the childhood abuse he faced at the hands of his father Joseph . The song is played in the key of E \u266d minor at a moderately fast tempo of 138 -- 139 beats per minute . In the song , Jackson 's vocal range is B3 to D5 . Drums on the song were played by Toto co-founder Jeff Porcaro .

'' -- Greg Burk , South Coast Today . `` Beat It '' was released on February 14 , 1983 , following the successful chart performances of `` The Girl Is Mine '' and `` Billie Jean '' . Frank DiLeo , the vice president of Epic Records , convinced Jackson to release `` Beat It '' while `` Billie Jean '' was heading towards No. 1 . Dileo , who would later become the singer 's manager , predicted that both singles would remain in the Top 10 at the same time . `` Billie Jean '' remained atop the Billboard Hot 100 for seven weeks , before being toppled by `` Come On Eileen '' , which stayed at No. 1 for a single week , before Jackson reclaimed the position with `` Beat It '' . `` Billie Jean '' and `` Beat It '' occupied Top 5 positions at the same time , a feat matched by very few artists . The single remained at the top of the Hot 100 for a total of three weeks . The song also charted at No. 1 on the US R&B singles chart and No. 14 on the Billboard Top Tracks chart in the US . Billboard ranked it at the No. 5 song for 1983 . `` Beat It '' also claimed the top spot in Spain and The Netherlands , reached No. 3 in the UK and the Top 20 in Austria , Norway , Italy , Sweden and Switzerland . In a Rolling Stone review , Christopher Connelly describes `` Beat It '' as the best song on Thriller , adding that it `` ai n't no disco AOR track '' .
