The point of the analogy is that a national and international institution (the All England Club) can be highly successful despite the lack of strong native competition, as in modern tennis Britain has produced very few Wimbledon champions, with only Ann Haydon Jones, Virginia Wade (both women's singles), Jonathan Marray (men's doubles), Andy Murray (men's singles), John Lloyd, Jeremy Bates, Jo Durie, Jamie Murray and Heather Watson (mixed doubles) winning titles in the Open Era.\n\n## 2013 Rai Open \u2013 Doubles\n\nDustin Brown and Jonathan Marray were the defending champions but Marray decided not to participate. <br>\n\n## 2016 Aircel Chennai Open \u2013 Doubles\n\nLu Yen-hsun and Jonathan Marray were the defending champions, but Lu chose not to compete this year and Marray chose to compete in Brisbane instead. <br>\n\n## 2012 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Men's Doubles\n\nBob Bryan and Mike Bryan were the defending champions, but lost to wildcards Jonathan Marray and Frederik Nielsen in the semifinals.

It was developed by the German mathematician Erwin Fehlberg and is based on the large class of Runge\u2013Kutta methods.\n\n## Trefftz method\n\nIn mathematics, the Trefftz method is a method for the numerical solution of partial differential equations named after the German mathematician Erich Trefftz (1888\u20131937).

These methods were developed around 1900 by the German mathematicians C. Runge and M. W. Kutta.\n\n## Kutta condition\n\nThe Kutta condition is a principle in steady-flow fluid dynamics, especially aerodynamics, that is applicable to solid bodies with sharp corners, such as the trailing edges of airfoils.  It is named for German mathematician and aerodynamicist Martin Wilhelm Kutta.\n\n## Kutta\u2013Joukowski theorem\n\nThe Kutta\u2013Joukowski theorem is a fundamental theorem of aerodynamics used for the calculation of the lift of an airfoil and any two-dimensional bodies including circular cylinders translating in a uniform fluid at a constant speed large enough so that the flow seen in the body-fixed frame is steady and unseparated.  The theorem relates the lift generated by an airfoil to the speed of the airfoil through the fluid, the density of the fluid and the circulation around the airfoil.  The circulation is defined as the line integral around a closed loop enclosing the airfoil of the component of the velocity of the fluid tangent to the loop.  It is named after the German Martin Wilhelm Kutta and the Russian Nikolai Zhukovsky (or Joukowski) who first developed its key ideas in the early 20th century.  Kutta\u2013Joukowski theorem is an inviscid theory, but it is a good approximation for real viscous flow in typical aerodynamic applications.\n\n## Frank Natterer\n\nFrank Natterer (July 20, 1941) is a German mathematician.
