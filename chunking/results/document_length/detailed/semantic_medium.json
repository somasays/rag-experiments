The Commemorative Air Force\u2019s Gulf Coast Wing \"Texas Raiders\" group maintains and flies the aircraft.  She is hangared at General Aviation Services, which is located at Conroe North Houston Regional Airport in Conroe, Texas.\n\n## Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress\n\nThe Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress is a four-engine heavy bomber developed in the 1930s for the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC).  Competing against Douglas and Martin for a contract to build 200 bombers, the Boeing entry (prototype Model 299/XB-17) outperformed both competitors and exceeded the air corps' performance specifications.  Although Boeing lost the contract (to the Douglas B-18 Bolo) because the prototype crashed, the air corps ordered 13 more B-17s for further evaluation.  From its introduction in 1938, the B-17 Flying Fortress evolved through numerous design advances, becoming the third-most produced bomber of all time, behind the B-24 and the multirole Ju 88.\n\n## Northrop YB-35\n\nThe Northrop XB-35 and YB-35 were experimental heavy bomber aircraft developed by the Northrop Corporation for the United States Army Air Forces during and shortly after World War II.  The airplane used the radical and potentially very efficient flying wing design, in which the tail section and fuselage are eliminated and all payload is carried in a thick wing.  Only prototype and pre-production aircraft were built, although interest remained strong enough to warrant further development of the design as a jet bomber, under the designation YB-49.\n\n## Mitsubishi Ki-1\n\nThe Mitsubishi Ki-1, also known as Mitsubishi Army Type 93 Heavy Bomber, was a bomber built by Mitsubishi for the Imperial Japanese Army in the 1930s, which flew for the first time in 1933.  Despite its antiquated appearance, the Ki-1 was used in Manchukuo and in north China during the early stages of the Second Sino-Japanese War, in areas where danger from enemy fighter aircraft was minimal.\n\n## Heinkel He 277\n\nThe Heinkel He 277 was a four-engine, long-range heavy bomber design, originating as a derivative of the He 177, intended for production and use by the German Luftwaffe during World War II.  The main difference was in engine configuration.  Rather than using two fire-prone Daimler-Benz DB 606 \"power system\" engines, each of which consisted of side-by-side paired Daimler-Benz DB 601s and with each DB 606 \"power system\" weighing 1.5 tonnes apiece \u2014 or two of the similar DB 610, each of which used a pair of DB 605 engines in a similar \"twinned\" configuration on later He 177A airframes (the A-3 model and onwards), the He 277 was meant from the outset to use four BMW 801E 14-cylinder radial engines, each mounted in an individual nacelle and each turning a three-blade, four-meter diameter propeller.  The design was never produced, and not a single prototype airframe was ever completed, owing both to the deteriorating condition of the German aviation industry late in the war, and the competition from other long-range bomber designs from other firms, competing for Germany's increasingly scarce aviation production capacity.  Although not specifically intended for it at first, partially due to the time-frame in the spring of 1942 in which its ultimate niche was requested for by the RLM, the He 277 design essentially became Heinkel's entry in the important trans-oceanic range \"Amerika Bomber\" competition, struggling to compete against both several other designs from rival firms in the competition for a truly trans-oceanic ranged bomber for the Luftwaffe, and Germany's own rapidly degrading ability, from Allied bombing damage to its aviation plants, to produce military aircraft of any sort.\n\n## Witteman-Lewis XNBL-1\n\nThe Wittemann-Lewis NBL-1 \"Barling Bomber\" was an experimental long-range, heavy bomber built for the United States Army Air Service in the early 1920s.  Although unsuccessful as a bomber, it was an early attempt at creating a strategic bomber.",
