Kutta.\n\n## Kutta condition\n\nThe Kutta condition is a principle in steady-flow fluid dynamics, especially aerodynamics, that is applicable to solid bodies with sharp corners, such as the trailing edges of airfoils.  It is named for German mathematician and aerodynamicist Martin Wilhelm Kutta.\n\n## Kutta\u2013Joukowski theorem\n\nThe Kutta\u2013Joukowski theorem is a fundamental theorem of aerodynamics used for the calculation of the lift of an airfoil and any two-dimensional bodies including circular cylinders translating in a uniform fluid at a constant speed large enough so that the flow seen in the body-fixed frame is steady and unseparated.  The theorem relates the lift generated by an airfoil to the speed of the airfoil through the fluid, the density of the fluid and the circulation around the airfoil.  The circulation is defined as the line integral around a closed loop enclosing the airfoil of the component of the velocity of the fluid tangent to the loop.  It is named after the German Martin Wilhelm Kutta and the Russian Nikolai Zhukovsky (or Joukowski) who first developed its key ideas in the early 20th century.  Kutta\u2013Joukowski theorem is an inviscid theory, but it is a good approximation for real viscous flow in typical aerodynamic applications.\n\n## Frank Natterer\n\nFrank Natterer (July 20, 1941) is a German mathematician.
