It was launched in 1887 by the British publisher Henry Vizetelly and under the general editorship of Havelock Ellis.  Around 1894 the series was taken over by the London firm of T. Fisher Unwin.  Many well-known literary figures edited or introduced the texts.  Some of the plays published had not been reprinted in recent editions, and most had dropped out of the stage repertoire.\n\n## The Old Wives' Tale\n\nThe Old Wives' Tale is a novel by Arnold Bennett, first published in 1908.

It covers a period of about 70 years from roughly 1840 to 1905, and is set in Burslem and Paris.  It is generally regarded as one of Bennett's finest works.\n\n## John Dicks (publisher)\n\nJohn Thomas Dicks (1818-1881) was a publisher in London in the 19th century.

All four are set in the \"Five Towns\", Bennett's thinly disguised version of the six towns of the Potteries district that merged into the borough (later city) of Stoke-on-Trent.  Buildings described in the novels are still identifiable in Burslem, the basis for the fictional town of \"Bursley\".\n\n## The Grand Babylon Hotel\n\nThe Grand Babylon Hotel is a novel by Arnold Bennett, published in January 1902, about the mysterious disappearance of a German prince.  It originally appeared as a serial in the \"Golden Penny\".  The titular Grand Babylon was modelled on the Savoy Hotel which Bennett had much later also used as a model for his 1930 novel \"Imperial Palace\".\n\n## Autoeroticism\n\nAutoeroticism is the practice of becoming sexually stimulated through internal stimuli.  The term was popularized toward the end of the 19th century by British sexologist Havelock Ellis, who defined autoeroticism as \"the phenomena of spontaneous sexual emotion generated in the absence of an external stimulus proceeding, directly or indirectly, from another person\".\n\n## Arnold Bennett\n\nEnoch Arnold Bennett (27 May 1867 \u2013 27 March 1931) was an English writer.

He was co-author of the first medical textbook in English on homosexuality in 1897, and also published works on a variety of sexual practices and inclinations, as well as transgender psychology.  He is credited with introducing the notions of narcissism and autoeroticism, later adopted by psychoanalysis.  Like many intellectuals of his era, he supported eugenics and he served as president of the Eugenics Society.",

The NGB was initially projected to enter service around 2018 as a stealthy, subsonic, medium-range, medium payload bomber to supplement and possibly\u2014to a limited degree\u2014replace the U.S. Air Force's aging bomber fleet (B-52 Stratofortress and B-1 Lancer).  The NGB program was superseded by the Long Range Strike Bomber (LRS-B) heavy bomber program.\n\n## Texas Raiders\n\nTexas Raiders is an American Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, a Douglas-Long Beach built B-17G-95-DL.  The Commemorative Air Force\u2019s Gulf Coast Wing \"Texas Raiders\" group maintains and flies the aircraft.  She is hangared at General Aviation Services, which is located at Conroe North Houston Regional Airport in Conroe, Texas.\n\n## Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress\n\nThe Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress is a four-engine heavy bomber developed in the 1930s for the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC).  Competing against Douglas and Martin for a contract to build 200 bombers, the Boeing entry (prototype Model 299/XB-17) outperformed both competitors and exceeded the air corps' performance specifications.  Although Boeing lost the contract (to the Douglas B-18 Bolo) because the prototype crashed, the air corps ordered 13 more B-17s for further evaluation.  From its introduction in 1938, the B-17 Flying Fortress evolved through numerous design advances, becoming the third-most produced bomber of all time, behind the B-24 and the multirole Ju 88.\n\n## Northrop YB-35\n\nThe Northrop XB-35 and YB-35 were experimental heavy bomber aircraft developed by the Northrop Corporation for the United States Army Air Forces during and shortly after World War II.  The airplane used the radical and potentially very efficient flying wing design, in which the tail section and fuselage are eliminated and all payload is carried in a thick wing.  Only prototype and pre-production aircraft were built, although interest remained strong enough to warrant further development of the design as a jet bomber, under the designation YB-49.\n\n## Mitsubishi Ki-1\n\nThe Mitsubishi Ki-1, also known as Mitsubishi Army Type 93 Heavy Bomber, was a bomber built by Mitsubishi for the Imperial Japanese Army in the 1930s, which flew for the first time in 1933.  Despite its antiquated appearance, the Ki-1 was used in Manchukuo and in north China during the early stages of the Second Sino-Japanese War, in areas where danger from enemy fighter aircraft was minimal.\n\n## Heinkel He 277\n\nThe Heinkel He 277 was a four-engine, long-range heavy bomber design, originating as a derivative of the He 177, intended for production and use by the German Luftwaffe during World War II.  The main difference was in engine configuration.",

The main difference was in engine configuration.  Rather than using two fire-prone Daimler-Benz DB 606 \"power system\" engines, each of which consisted of side-by-side paired Daimler-Benz DB 601s and with each DB 606 \"power system\" weighing 1.5 tonnes apiece \u2014 or two of the similar DB 610, each of which used a pair of DB 605 engines in a similar \"twinned\" configuration on later He 177A airframes (the A-3 model and onwards), the He 277 was meant from the outset to use four BMW 801E 14-cylinder radial engines, each mounted in an individual nacelle and each turning a three-blade, four-meter diameter propeller.  The design was never produced, and not a single prototype airframe was ever completed, owing both to the deteriorating condition of the German aviation industry late in the war, and the competition from other long-range bomber designs from other firms, competing for Germany's increasingly scarce aviation production capacity.  Although not specifically intended for it at first, partially due to the time-frame in the spring of 1942 in which its ultimate niche was requested for by the RLM, the He 277 design essentially became Heinkel's entry in the important trans-oceanic range \"Amerika Bomber\" competition, struggling to compete against both several other designs from rival firms in the competition for a truly trans-oceanic ranged bomber for the Luftwaffe, and Germany's own rapidly degrading ability, from Allied bombing damage to its aviation plants, to produce military aircraft of any sort.\n\n## Witteman-Lewis XNBL-1\n\nThe Wittemann-Lewis NBL-1 \"Barling Bomber\" was an experimental long-range, heavy bomber built for the United States Army Air Service in the early 1920s.

White: \u201cI guess everyone has crazy brothers and sisters.  I know I have.  Stan, by the way, has taken out a patent on an invention of his called \u2018Botanical Bricks,\u2019 which are simply plant units capable of being built up to any height, for quick landscape effects, the vertical surfaces covered with flowering vines, or the like.  He thinks that the idea has great possibilities for such things as world fairs, city yards, indoor gardens, and many other projects.  I think perhaps he has got hold of something, and have written him for more information.  He certainly deserves a break.\u201d  Stanley refined the vertical garden typology with his patent for the \"vegetation-Bearing Architectonic Structure and System (1938)\" in which he outlines the scope for a new field of vegetation-bearing architecture.  The impact of this invention has still unrealized provocations on this history of gardens and designed landscapes, establishing precedent for verdant modernism in the prewar Middle West.  The wall was reconstructed in 2012-13 as part of a Graham Foundation Research Award.  Stanley Hart White is also known for his innovative teaching style and his influence on the work of Richard Haag, Hideo Sasaki, Peter Walker, Stu Dawson, Philip H.

It used a BMW four-cylinder turbocharged engine tilted over on its side to allow a clear supply of air to the rear wing.  The car competed during the 1986 Formula One season.  It was not successful and its introduction coincided with the end of Brabham's time as a competitive team.

Initiated by Ron Tauranac, designed by Geoff Ferris, and built by a team including Nick Goozee (monocoque) and Bob Paton (construction), it was one of the last cars produced by MRD before MRD was closed by the then new Brabham owner Bernie Ecclestone.  Based on the Formula Two Brabham BT40 (which was also designed by Geoff Ferris) the BT43 featured a modified monocoque that incorporated the triangular cross section pioneered by the Brabham BT42 Formula One car which was designed by Gordon Murray.  This distinctive pyramid shape not only kept the aerodynamic \"stagnation point\" low but also neatly allowed the incorporation of a \"crushable structure\" as required by the 1973 regulations which specified that all fuel tanks were to be protected by deformable structures.  Engine and gearbox were the then de facto F5000 standard combination of a Chevrolet 302 cubic inch engine in an unstressed mounting and a Hewland DG300 gearbox.  The fitment of these into what was a relatively small Formula Two sized car presented some design challenges.

The 'lamps' of the title are Ruskin's principles of architecture, which he later enlarged upon in the three-volume \"The Stones of Venice\".  To an extent, they codified some of the contemporary thinking behind the Gothic Revival.  At the time of its publication A. W. N. Pugin and others had already advanced the ideas of the Revival and it was well under way in practice.  Ruskin offered little new to the debate, but the book helped to capture and summarise the thoughts of the movement.  \"The Seven Lamps\" also proved a great popular success, and received the approval of the ecclesiologists typified by the Cambridge Camden Society, who criticised in their publication \"The Ecclesiologist\" lapses committed by modern architects in ecclesiastical commissions.\n\n## Ruskin Pottery\n\nThe Ruskin Pottery was an English pottery studio founded in 1898 by Edward R.

The book was primarily written as a defence of the later work of J.M.W. Turner.  Ruskin used the book to argue that art should devote itself to the accurate documentation of nature.  In Ruskin's view, Turner had developed from early detailed documentation of nature to a later more profound insight into natural forces and atmospheric effects.  It was in his 1842 visit to Switzerland that Ruskin collected material used to form the basis of Vol One.\n\n## The Passion of John Ruskin\n\nThe Passion of John Ruskin is a Canadian short film released in 1994 based on the love life of writer and critic John Ruskin.

The first commercial brewery was La Brasseries due Roy [sic] started by New France Intendant Jean Talon, in Qu\u00e9bec City in 1668.  Many commercial brewers thrived until Prohibition in Canada.  The provincial and federal governments' attempt to eliminate \"intoxicating\" beverages led to the closing of nearly three quarters of breweries between 1878 and 1928.  It was only in the second half of the twentieth century that a significant number of new breweries opened up.  The Canadian Beer industry now plays an important role in Canadian identity, though globalization of the brewing industry has seen the major players in Canada acquired by, or merged with, foreign companies, notably its three largest beer producers, Labatt, Molson and Sleeman.

He was a leader of a mass movement called Pan-Africanism and he founded the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League (UNIA-ACL).  He also founded the Black Star Line, a shipping and passenger line which promoted the return of the African diaspora to their ancestral lands.

The Black Star Line, founded in 1919 by Marcus Garvey as part of the Back-to-Africa movement, modelled its name on that of the White Star Line, changing the colour from white to black to symbolise ownership by black people rather than white people.  The black star became a symbol of Pan-Africanism and anti-colonialism.  Described as the \"Lodestar of African Freedom\", the black star was used in 1957 by Theodosia Okoh in the design of the Flag of Ghana.\n\n## Back-to-Africa movement\n\nThe Back-to-Africa movement, also known as the Colonization movement or Black Zionism, originated in the United States in the 19th century.

Though the series is commonly referred to as a \"trilogy\", and the first three novels were published in a single volume, as \"The Clayhanger Family\", in 1925, there are actually four books.  All four are set in the \"Five Towns\", Bennett's thinly disguised version of the six towns of the Potteries district that merged into the borough (later city) of Stoke-on-Trent.  Buildings described in the novels are still identifiable in Burslem, the basis for the fictional town of \"Bursley\".\n\n## The Grand Babylon Hotel\n\nThe Grand Babylon Hotel is a novel by Arnold Bennett, published in January 1902, about the mysterious disappearance of a German prince.

The term was popularized toward the end of the 19th century by British sexologist Havelock Ellis, who defined autoeroticism as \"the phenomena of spontaneous sexual emotion generated in the absence of an external stimulus proceeding, directly or indirectly, from another person\".\n\n## Arnold Bennett\n\nEnoch Arnold Bennett (27 May 1867 \u2013 27 March 1931) was an English writer.  He is best known as a novelist, but he also worked in other fields such as the theatre, journalism, propaganda and films.\n\n## Havelock Ellis\n\nHenry Havelock Ellis, known as Havelock Ellis (2 February 1859 \u2013 8 July 1939), was an English physician, writer, progressive intellectual and social reformer who studied human sexuality.  He was co-author of the first medical textbook in English on homosexuality in 1897, and also published works on a variety of sexual practices and inclinations, as well as transgender psychology.  He is credited with introducing the notions of narcissism and autoeroticism, later adopted by psychoanalysis.  Like many intellectuals of his era, he supported eugenics and he served as president of the Eugenics Society.",

Shirer.  Shirer, a radio reporter for CBS, covered Germany for several years until the Nazi press censors made it impossible for him to report objectively to his listeners in the United States; feeling increasingly uncomfortable, he left the country.  The identities of many of Shirer's German sources were disguised to protect these people from retaliation by the German secret police, the Gestapo.  The contents of this book provided much of the material for his landmark book \"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\".\n\n## Fukomys vandewoestijneae\n\nFukomys vandewoestijneae or Caroline\u2019s mole rat was first noticed in 2002 by a research team from the University of Ghent.

They are similar to the \"Sweet Pickles\" books in that each letter of the alphabet is represented in a separate book with an animal representing each letter.  Each story was filled with words and objects that begin with the letter of the alphabet featured in that book.  A special word page at the end of each book provided extra practice in identifying letters and words.  The series was initially published in the early 1990s.\n\n## Patterns of Sexual Behavior\n\nPatterns of Sexual Behavior is a 1951 book by Clellan S. Ford and Frank A. Beach.  In this work of scientific literature, the authors integrate information about human sexual behavior from 191 different cultures, and include detailed comparisons across animal species, with particular emphasis on primates.  The book, which has been called a \"classic\" of its field, provided the foundation for the later research of Masters and Johnson.  A revised edition, titled \"Human Sexuality in Four Perspectives\", was published in 1977.\n\n## Josef Peukert\n\nJosef Peukert (22 January 1855 \u2013 3 March 1910) was a German Bohemian anarchist known for his autobiographical book \"Memoirs from the proletarian revolutionary labour movement\" (German: \"Erinnerungen eines Proletariers aus der revolution\u00e4ren Arbeiterbewegung\" ).  The book provided a glimpse into the early days of the radical labour movement in Austria, the start of the anarchist movement in Germany and the exile of the anarchists in London and America at the time of Socialist Law (1878-1890).  The accuracy of the book was questioned by fellow anarchist and historian Max Nettlau, who looked upon it in a \"highly-skeptical\" manner.\n\n## Masters and Johnson\n\nThe Masters and Johnson research team, composed of William H.

Initially assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet, she was transferred to the Home Fleet in 1936.  During the Spanish Civil War of 1936\u20131939, the ship spent considerable time in Spanish waters, enforcing the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France on both sides of the conflict.  \"Bulldog\" saw service throughout World War II on convoy escort duty during the Battle of the Atlantic and in the Arctic.  Her most notable actions were the capture of a complete Enigma machine and codebooks from the German submarine \"U-110\" in 1941, and sinking another German submarine in 1944.

The main difference was in engine configuration.  Rather than using two fire-prone Daimler-Benz DB 606 \"power system\" engines, each of which consisted of side-by-side paired Daimler-Benz DB 601s and with each DB 606 \"power system\" weighing 1.5 tonnes apiece \u2014 or two of the similar DB 610, each of which used a pair of DB 605 engines in a similar \"twinned\" configuration on later He 177A airframes (the A-3 model and onwards), the He 277 was meant from the outset to use four BMW 801E 14-cylinder radial engines, each mounted in an individual nacelle and each turning a three-blade, four-meter diameter propeller.  The design was never produced, and not a single prototype airframe was ever completed, owing both to the deteriorating condition of the German aviation industry late in the war, and the competition from other long-range bomber designs from other firms, competing for Germany's increasingly scarce aviation production capacity.  Although not specifically intended for it at first, partially due to the time-frame in the spring of 1942 in which its ultimate niche was requested for by the RLM, the He 277 design essentially became Heinkel's entry in the important trans-oceanic range \"Amerika Bomber\" competition, struggling to compete against both several other designs from rival firms in the competition for a truly trans-oceanic ranged bomber for the Luftwaffe, and Germany's own rapidly degrading ability, from Allied bombing damage to its aviation plants, to produce military aircraft of any sort.\n\n## Witteman-Lewis XNBL-1\n\nThe Wittemann-Lewis NBL-1 \"Barling Bomber\" was an experimental long-range, heavy bomber built for the United States Army Air Service in the early 1920s.
