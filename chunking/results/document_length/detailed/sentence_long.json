It is a widespread species in West Africa and found in Senegal, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Ivory Coast, as well as in Togo and Benin; it is assumed to occur in Ghana and southeastern Burkina Faso, although it has not been recorded there.  On the other hand, some records may refer to other species; the Amphibian Species of the World excludes Gambia and Togo from the distribution.  Common names Liberia grassland frog and Tournier's rocket frog are sometimes used.\n\n## West Africa\n\nWest Africa, also called Western Africa and the West of Africa, is the westernmost subregion of Africa.  West Africa has been defined as including 18 countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, the island nation of Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, the island of Saint Helena, Senegal, Sierra Leone, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe and Togo.

His father, Alhaji Yahya Sillah, now 100 years old, served as Regent Chief (Acting Paramount Chief) for several years in Dama Chiefdom, Kenema District in the early seventies.  Alhaji Yahya Sillah was appointed to that high position by Sierra Leone President Siaka Stevens.  His mother, Haja Mamie Zoe Mansaray, was a home maker.  A journalist and human rights activist, Mohamed Yahya Sillah was a vocal torch-bearer in the transition efforts from military to civilian rule in Sierra Leone, 1996.  As Leader and National Chairman of National Alliance Democratic Party (NADP), he competed the 1996 Presidential elections in Sierra Leone, becoming one of only thirteen political leaders that qualified to contest the Presidential and Parliamentary elections in the country at the age of 46.  His adoring personality lured many Sierra Leoneans and media practitioners to view him as one of the most eloquent and charismatic politicians in Sierra Leone.  Nevertheless, he received only 0.5% of the votes (3,723 total votes), good for 13th place.  Although he protested the election results on BBC's Focus on Africa, he later suspended his protest \"for the sake of peace.\"  Mohamed Yahya Sillah continues to enjoy massive support from the youth and women supporters in Sierra Leone.  In 2007, he withdrew his bid for national leadership in the Presidential and Parliamentary elections, citing inadequate funding and ineffective campaign management machinery.  He later put his weight behind the Sierra Leone Peoples Party (SLPP) presidential candidate, Vice President Solomon Berewa.  When Berewa lost the elections, Mohamed Yahya Sillah gracefully congratulated the winning candidate, Ernest Bai Koroma, of the All People's Congress (APC) party.  Mohamed Yahya Sillah vows to respect and help protect the dignity of any Sierra Leonean that is legitimately and democratically elected to office by the people of Sierra Leone.\n\n## Cocoa production in Ivory Coast\n\nIvory Coast (C\u00f4te d'Ivoire) leads the world in production and export of the cocoa beans used in the manufacture of chocolate, as of 2012, supplying 33% of cocoa produced in the world.  West Africa collectively supplies two thirds of the world's cocoa crop, with Ivory Coast leading production at 1.8 million tonnes as of 2017, and nearby Ghana, Nigeria, Cameroon and Togo producing additional 1.55 million tonnes.  Ivory Coast overtook Ghana as the world's leading producer of cocoa beans in 1978, and today is highly dependent on the crop, which accounts for 40% of national export income.  The primary non-African competitor of Ivory Coast is Indonesia, which went from having almost nonexistent domestic cocoa industry in the 1970s to becoming one of the largest producers in the market by the early 2000s.  According to the UN FAO, Indonesia overtook Ghana and became the second-largest producer worldwide in 2006.",

They were known locally as saros (elided form of Sierra Leone, from the Yoruba \"s\u00e0r\u00f3\") or Amaros: migrants from Brazil and Cuba.  Saros and Amaros also settled in other West African countries such as the Gold Coast (Ghana).  They were mostly freed and repatriated slaves from various West African and Latin American countries such as Sierra Leone, Brazil and Cuba.  Liberated \"returnee\" Africans from Brazil were more commonly known as \"Agudas\", from the word \"\u00e0g\u00f9d\u00e0\" in the Yoruba language.  Most of the Latin American returnees or Amaros started migrating to Africa after slavery was abolished on the continent while others from West Africa, or the Saros were recaptured and freed slaves already resident in Sierra Leone.  Many of the returnees chose to return to Nigeria for cultural, missionary and economic reasons.  Many (if not the greater majority) of them were originally descended from the Yoruba of western and central Nigeria.

The character may be identified as a diagnosed/assessed psychopath or sociopath within the fictional work itself, or by its creator when discussing their intentions with the work, which might be distinguished from opinions of audiences or critics based only on a character appearing to show traits or behaviors associated with an undefined popular stereotype of psychopathy.\n\n## Tommy Carcetti\n\nThomas J. \"Tommy\" Carcetti ( ) is a fictional character on the HBO drama \"The Wire\", played by Aidan Gillen.  Carcetti is an ambitious Baltimore politician who begins the series with a seat on the city council.\n\n## Saint John's Cathedral Boys' School\n\nSaint John's Cathedral Boys' School (SJCBS) was a school that was located in Selkirk, Manitoba.  It was founded in the early 1960s by Ted Byfield and Frank Wiens.  The two started an Anglican lay order called the Company of the Cross, claimed to be based on a reading of some of C.S. Lewis's writings.  The Company of the Cross was under the authority of the resident bishop in Winnipeg, officially called the Diocese of Rupert's Land.  The teachers were paid $1.00 per day and provided room and board.  Two other schools, Saint John's School of Alberta and Saint John's School of Ontario were founded on the same ideas in later years.  Arduous row-boat trips (called \"cutters\"), later replaced by canoes, and snowshoeing and dog-sledding were part of the outdoor education program.  The school's founders believed that boys should be pushed to what they might believe is their breaking points, and this would \"build character\".  The school was seen by many as a way to help troubled boys, usually from 11 to 14 years of age.  Its primary focus was challenging boys from every social stratum to work together in order to grow morally, physically, intellectually and spiritually in the tradition of Victorian \"muscular Christianity\".\n\n## Yossarian\n\nCapt.

The band generated tremendous energy and had a devoted following, but struggled to sign to a record label.  In 1981, the band relocated to New York City.  Shortly thereafter, John Linnell left the band to pursue another musical project, They Might Be Giants, with John Flansburgh.  Drummer Kevin Tooley was replaced by Peter Clemente, and Jim Gillson replaced John Linnell on keyboards.  The band continued to gig in New England and played frequently in New York City venues, including CBGB.

There is some idea that it descended into Greek from the Proto-Indo-European language.  In that regard Robert Graves has proposed the only Greek derivation available.  Perseus might be from the Greek verb, \"\u03c0\u03ad\u03c1\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd\" (\"perthein\"), \u201cto waste, ravage, sack, destroy\u201d, some form of which appears in Homeric epithets.  According to Carl Darling Buck (\"Comparative Grammar of Greek and Latin\"), the \"\u2013eus\" suffix is typically used to form an agent noun, in this case from the aorist stem, \"pers-\".  \"Pers-eus\" therefore is a sacker of cities; that is, a soldier by occupation, a fitting name for the first Mycenaean warrior.\n\n## Khirbet Qeiyafa\n\nKhirbet Qeiyafa (Elah Fortress; Hirbet Kaifeh) is the site of an ancient fortress city overlooking the Elah Valley.  The ruins of the fortress were uncovered in 2007, near the Israeli city of Beit Shemesh, 30 km from Jerusalem.  It covers nearly 2.5 ha and is encircled by a 700-meter-long (2,300\u00a0ft) city wall constructed of stones weighing up to eight tons each.  A number of archaeologists, mainly Yosef Garfinkel and Saar Ganor, have claimed that it might be the biblical city of Sha'arayim, because of the two gates discovered on the site, or Neta'im and that the large building at the center is an administrative building dating to the reign of King David, where he might have lodged at some point.  this is based on their conclusions that the site dates to the early Iron IIA, ca. 1025\u2013975 BCE, a range which includes the biblical date for the Kingdom of David.  Others are sceptical, and suggest it might represent either a North Israelite, Philistine or Canaanite fortress.  The techniques and interpretations used to reach the conclusion that Khirbet Qeiyafa was a fortress of King David have been criticised.\n\n## Lincoln (album)\n\nLincoln is the second album by the band They Might Be Giants.  It was released by Bar/None in 1988.  The album is named after the capital city of Lincoln, Nebraska and John Linnell and John Flansburgh's boyhood home of Lincoln, Massachusetts.  The album produced three singles \u2014 \"Ana Ng\", \"They'll Need a Crane\", and \"Purple Toupee\".  It is included on \"\", a compilation of the band's early material, in its entirety.\n\n## John Capozzi\n\nJohn James Capozzi, Jr. (D) served as the second District of Columbia Shadow U.S. Representative, during 1995-1997 and is a former 17 year at-large member of the District of Columbia Democratic State Committee.  He ran as a Candidate to become an At-Large Councilmember on the Council of the District of Columbia and was defeated September 10, 1996.  Capozzi is considered the possible inspiration for the character Tommy Carcetti in the HBO drama \"The Wire\".  He previously worked for BRMi Consulting as a Recruitment Manager.  Currently, Capozzi works for the Office of the Chief Technology Officer of the District of Columbia as a Project Manager.",

His regular position was as a forward.  He played for Westerlea, Ayr, and Manchester United.  Kerr joined Ayr from Westerlea in 1903, but only spent half a season there before joining Manchester United in January 1904.

Studies in HSR investigate how social factors, health policy, financing systems, organizational structures and processes, medical technology, and personal behaviors affect access to health care, the quality and cost of health care, and quantity and quality of life.

Written by Madonna, Stuart Price and Joe Henry, the song was supposed to be released as the third single of the album.  However, since \"Get Together\" was decided as the third single, \"Jump\" was released as the fourth and final single from the album, on October 31, 2006 by Warner Bros.  Records.  The song incorporates techno music with tributes to Pet Shop Boys.  Madonna sings in her lower register in the song.  Its lyrics talk about self-empowerment and sufficiency while looking for the prospects of a new relationship.\n\n## Hope That We Can Be Together Soon\n\n\"Hope That We Can Be Together Soon is a song written by Kenneth Gamble and Leon Huff that was originally recorded by Dusty Springfield as \"Let's Get Together Soon\" and was included in her 1970 album \"A Brand New Me\" (which was also produced by Gamble and Huff).

Released in 1975 from the album \"To Be True\", it reached #1 on the Hot Soul Singles chart in the summer of that year.  It reached #42 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100.

Produced by Madonna and Stuart Price, the song was released as the third single from the album by Warner Bros.  Records on June 6, 2006.  The decision was spurred by the fact that \"Get Together\" was the third most downloaded song from the album.  It was also released to coincide with the start of Madonna's Confessions Tour.  Inspired by Stardust's single \"Music Sounds Better with You\", \"Get Together\" portrays an anthem-like picture with its lyrics, about the different possibilities of finding love on the dance floor.\n\n## Love Don't Live Here Anymore\n\n\"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\" is a song written by Miles Gregory and originally recorded by Rose Royce.  It was produced by former Motown songwriter and producer Norman Whitfield for Whitfield Records.

Together they asked songwriter Miles Gregory to write a song for them.  Gregory was undergoing medications for his drug overuse problem, and this situation and his deteriorating physical health became the inspiration behind the song.  \"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\" incorporated the use of the Electronic LinnDrum machine, and was one of the first songs to effectively use the sound reverbs of the instrument.

This theory mainly explains the interpersonal interactions of a local group of people.  The theory is based on the belief that when people get together in a group, there are three main interpersonal needs they are looking to obtain \u2013 affection/openness, control and inclusion.  Schutz developed a measuring instrument that contains six scales of nine-item questions, and this became version B (for \"Behavior\").  This technique was created to measure how group members feel when it comes to inclusion, control, and affection/openness or to be able to get feedback from people in a group.\n\n## Confessions on a Dance Floor\n\nConfessions on a Dance Floor is the tenth studio album by American singer and songwriter Madonna.  It was released on November 9, 2005 by Warner Bros.  Records.  A complete departure from her previous studio album \"American Life\" (2003), the album includes influences of 1970s and 1980s disco, as well as modern-day club music.  Initially, she began working with Mirwais Ahmadza\u00ef for the album, but later felt that their collaboration was not going in the direction she desired.  Madonna took her collaboration with Stuart Price who was overviewing her documentary \"I'm Going to Tell You a Secret\".  The album was mainly recorded at Price's home-studio where Madonna spent most of her time during the recordings.\n\n## Luz de Vida\n\nLuz de Vida is a charity album benefiting the Tucson Together Fund, supporting those affected by the 2011 shooting in Tucson, Arizona, United States.

The album was released by Fort Lowell Records on October 18, 2011 on Bandcamp and as a limited-edition 12-song vinyl, and was sanctioned by Music Against Violence, a coalition of Tucson-based writers, recording engineers, and venue operators.

Finally Warner Bros. released it in the United States as a promotional single on September 18, 2001.  Written and produced by Madonna and Mirwais Ahmadza\u00ef, the track is bright and uplifting in its content and composition.  It was the first song that Madonna and Ahmadza\u00ef worked on and recorded.  Ahmadza\u00ef had to work separately on his laptop to generate the sound elements which Madonna wanted in the song, since it was difficult to generate the music in the recording studio.  \"Impressive Instant\" has been described as a club-savvy stomper containing futuristic keyboard lines, with Madonna's vocals being distorted and robotic.

The two albums saw two single releases, with Robyn citing that only one single would be released per mini-album.\n\n## Introducing ... Talk Talk\n\nIntroducing ... Talk Talk is a compilation album by Talk Talk released in 2003 (one of many \"best of\" albums of the band released by coincidence the same year).  \"Introducing ... Talk Talk\" is slightly different from the other \"best of\" albums by the band in that it doesn't include any of the band's hits.  The first five tracks come from the 1982\u20131984 period, including a piano version of \"Call in the Night Boy\", B-side to a non-album A-side in 1983.  Whilst the remaining seven tracks cover 1986\u20131988, the EMI era of the band's more experimental phase, most songs in this part of the album are drawn from \"The Colour of Spring\" and \"Spirit of Eden\".  Nothing post-1988 is featured, as EMI, who released the album, couldn't collect material from \"Laughing Stock\" or \"Missing Pieces\", both recorded over 1990\u20131991, or the live album \"London 1986\", released by Pond Life in 1999.",

This theory mainly explains the interpersonal interactions of a local group of people.  The theory is based on the belief that when people get together in a group, there are three main interpersonal needs they are looking to obtain \u2013 affection/openness, control and inclusion.  Schutz developed a measuring instrument that contains six scales of nine-item questions, and this became version B (for \"Behavior\").

Initially, she began working with Mirwais Ahmadza\u00ef for the album, but later felt that their collaboration was not going in the direction she desired.

Originally intended to be the fourth single of the album, the release was cancelled due to a disagreement between Madonna and her recording company.  Finally Warner Bros. released it in the United States as a promotional single on September 18, 2001.  Written and produced by Madonna and Mirwais Ahmadza\u00ef, the track is bright and uplifting in its content and composition.  It was the first song that Madonna and Ahmadza\u00ef worked on and recorded.  Ahmadza\u00ef had to work separately on his laptop to generate the sound elements which Madonna wanted in the song, since it was difficult to generate the music in the recording studio.  \"Impressive Instant\" has been described as a club-savvy stomper containing futuristic keyboard lines, with Madonna's vocals being distorted and robotic.  Backed by laser noises and synths, the song's lyrics deal with love at first sight, and contains nonsense lyrics.\n\n## Jump (Madonna song)\n\n\"Jump\" is a song by American singer Madonna from her tenth studio album \"Confessions on a Dance Floor\" (2005).

The fort succeeded in its peacekeeping mission for more than 50 years, as no massacres or battles occurred there.  The fort site is now managed by the Oklahoma Historical Society as the Fort Gibson Historical Site.  It is a National Historic Landmark.\n\n## Arizona State Route 389\n\nState Route 389, also known as SR 389, is a state highway in far northern Arizona serving the Arizona Strip.

Critics first described Audioslave as a combination of Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine, but by the band's second album, \"Out of Exile\", it was noted that they had established a separate identity.  Audioslave's sound was created by blending 1970s hard rock with 1990s alternative rock.  Moreover, Morello incorporated his well-known, unconventional guitar solos into the mix.  As with Rage Against the Machine, the band prided themselves on the fact that all sounds on their albums were produced using only guitar, bass, drums, and vocals.\n\n## Monashee Mountains\n\nThe Monashee Mountains are a mountain range lying mostly in British Columbia, Canada, extending into the U.S. state of Washington.

In 1995, her husband, Glenn Turner, died after allegedly being sick with the flu.  In 2001, the death of what had been described as her common law husband, Randy Thompson, under remarkably similar circumstances, aroused the suspicion of law enforcement.  After investigation, it was determined by authorities that Lynn Turner had murdered both her husbands by poisoning them with ethylene glycol-based antifreeze.  She was tried for Glenn Turner's murder in 2004.  She was found guilty and went to trial again for murdering Randy Thompson in 2007, ultimately being convicted.

Even though Mike DiMeo was initially chosen as the singer for the album after Joe Lynn Turner was fired, Ian Gillan eventually returned to the band in late 1992 and had to rework much of the material already existing for it, which had been intended for Joe Lynn Turner and DiMeo.  After his firing, Turner would admit Ritchie Blackmore referred to the album as \"The cattle grazes on\".  Blackmore became infuriated at the non-melodic elements and quit mid tour after the show of 17 November in Helsinki, Finland.  American guitarist Joe Satriani joined Deep Purple as a temporary replacement for the duration of the tour.  A handful of working tracks written during \"The Battle Rages On...\" sessions would turn up on subsequent solo releases by Turner, under different titles.\n\n## Twiggy Ramirez\n\nJeordie Osbourne White (born June 20, 1971), once known professionally as Twiggy Ramirez, shortened to just Twiggy since returning to Marilyn Manson, and sometimes referred to by his real name, is an American musician, mostly known as the bassist and guitarist of the band Marilyn Manson.

On the advice of Bolton, Turner began recording jingles for radio and television.  Other songs he had composed or through collaboration with songwriters like Desmond Child and Jack Ponti were being recorded and released by international recording artists Jimmy Barnes, Lee Aaron, and Bonfire.  Turner had a short-lived association with neoclassical metal guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen and then Deep Purple.  From the mid-1990s, he resumed his solo career, releasing an additional nine studio and two live recordings.  Turner did other session work, appearing as lead vocalist on tribute albums and working on projects involving various musical groups including progressive rock band Mother's Army; Bulgarian hard rock band Brazen Abbot; funk rock duo Hughes Turner Project; and classic rock/ progressive rock band Rated X.

In 1993, they were the first act signed to Trent Reznor's Nothing Records label.

During the seven-month period, the city of Zahle (Arabic: \u0632\u062d\u0644\u0629) endured a handful of political and military setbacks.  The opposing key players were on the one side, the Lebanese Forces or LF (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0648\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0628\u0646\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0629) aided by Zahlawi townspeople, and on the other side, the Syrian Armed Forces, then part of the peace-keeping Arab Deterrent Force or ADF (Arabic: \u0642\u0648\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062f\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629), aided by some Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) factions.  Demographically, Zahleh is one of the largest predominantly Christian towns in Lebanon.  Adjacent to the town's outskirts, the Bekaa valley (Arabic: \u0648\u0627\u062f\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0642\u0627\u0639), spanning the length of the Syrian borders.  Given Zahle's close proximity to the Bekaa Valley, the Syrian Armed Forces feared a potential alliance between Israel and the LF in Zahle.  This potential alliance would not only threaten the Syrian military presence in the Bekaa valley, but was regarded as a national security threat from the Syrians' point of view, given the close proximity between Zahle and the Beirut-Damascus highway.  Consequently, as a clamp-down strategy, the Syrian forces controlled the major roads leading in and out of the city and fortified the entire Valley.  Around December 1980, tension increased between Zahlawi Lebanese Forces and Syrian-backed Leftist militants.  From April to June 1981, throughout the four-month period, a handful of LF members, aided by Zahlawi Local Resistance, confronted the Syrian war machine and defended the city from Syrian intrusion and potential invasion.\n\n## Marsfield, New South Wales\n\nMarsfield is a suburb that is part of the Northern Suburbs of Sydney, Australia.  The green residential suburb is noted for its proximity to a number of leading scientific and tertiary educational institutions.

It is in close proximity to the Adelaide Botanic Garden, Hutt Street, and Victoria Park.\n\n## Whippingham railway station\n\nWhippingham railway station was arguably the most underused station on an often sparsely used network.  Built solely because of the need to have a station within close proximity to Osborne House, it is known that Queen Victoria did use the station on at least one occasion, on 11 February 1888, when she travelled from Whippingham to Ventnor and back for the opening of the National Consumption Hospital there.  The station is also known to have been used by the young Lord Mountbatten.  In its early days its passenger carrying status was ambiguous and, although always clean and tidy, never very busy.  A passing loop was added in 1912 and indeed was retained for a further three years after closure in 1953.  Trains continued to pass through the station until the line was closed in 1966.  The station house, now a splendid private dwelling, still stands with the only other building within any sort of close proximity being the Island crematorium.\n\n## London Nocturne\n\nThe Jupiter London Nocturne (formerly the Smithfield Nocturne) is a cycling race in London, United Kingdom.

It was caused by settler intrusion and slave raids on native lands and subsequent native retaliation, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of natives.  In 1859, a band of locally sponsored rangers led by Walter S. Jarboe, called the Eel River Rangers, raided the countryside in an effort to remove natives from settler territory and move them onto the Nome Cult Farm, an area near the Mendocino Indian Reservation.  By the time the Eel River Rangers were disbanded in 1860, Jarboe and his men had killed 283 warriors, captured 292, killed countless women and children, and only suffered 5 casualties themselves in just 23 engagements.  The bill to the state for the rangers\u2019 services amounted to $11,143.43.  Scholars, however, state that the damage to the area and natives in particular was even higher than reported, especially given the vast number of raiding parties formed outside of the Eel River Rangers.  Frustrated with the inadequacy of federal protection, settlers formed their own raiding parties against the natives, joining Jarboe in his mission to rid Round Valley of its native population.  Those that survived were moved to the Nome Cult Farm, where they experienced hardships typical of the reservation system of the day.  After the conflict, contemporaries claimed that the conflict was more of a slaughter than a war, and later historians have labeled it a genocide.\n\n## William Pynchon\n\nWilliam Pynchon (October 11, 1590 \u2013 October 29, 1662) was an English colonist and fur trader in North America best known as the founder of Springfield, Massachusetts, USA.

An original settler of Roxbury, Massachusetts, Pynchon became dissatisfied with that town's notoriously rocky soil and in 1635, led the initial settlement expedition to Springfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts, where he found exceptionally fertile soil and a fine spot for conducting trade.  In 1636, he returned to officially purchase its land, then known as \"Agawam.\"  In 1640, Springfield was officially renamed after Pynchon's home village, now a suburb of Chelmsford in Essex, England \u2014 due to Pynchon's grace following a dispute with Hartford, Connecticut's Captain John Mason over, essentially, whether to treat local natives as friends or enemies.  (Pynchon was a man of peace and also very business-minded \u2014 thus he advocated for friendship with the region's natives.)  Pynchon's stance led to Springfield aligning with the faraway government of the Massachusetts Bay Colony rather than the more geographically and ideologically compatible Connecticut Colony.\n\n## Chiguata District\n\nChiguata is a district located in the Arequipa province, 30 km away from the city of Arequipa, Peru, on the slopes of the volcano Pikchu Pikchu (where at its summit pre-Inca worshipped remains and artifacts have been found).  The name \"chiguata\" comes from the Quechua words \"chiri\" meaning \"cold\" and \"wata\" meaning \"year\" (cold all year).  Ancient Chiguata was inhabited by the local natives until the arrival of Spanish influence in charge of the emissary Diego Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdova in 1540.  Soon after, the construction of a small plaza was initiated, and according to the Dominican religious order and local sources, the plaza's \"Templo del Esp\u00edritu Santo\" (\"Sacred Spirit temple\") along with its domes and lateral cover was not begun until 1739.  The design of the temple is quite interesting, with two angels in feathered nightwear and their arms lifted vertically, separated by twelve fringes of rectangular flowers which add to the whole decoration of the temple.  Cherubs also decorate the circular cornice, along with four saints in full-length reliefs that occupy the \"pechinas\" of the columns that sustain the temple's dome, which is considered one of the most original works of the colony and now visited by occasional tourists.\n\n## Gwendolyn Elaine Armstrong\n\nGwendolyn Elaine Armstrong was a black Mississippi pioneer in the Civil Rights Movement.",

The conventional wisdom has the name \u2018palouse\u2019 being derived from the French term for the large treeless plain region in eastern Washington stretching into Idaho: the Palouse, a word meaning grassy spot or place.  However, Boone says that the name could originate from the name of a major village of Palouse Indians, Palus, located at the confluence of the Palouse and Snake Rivers.  'Palus' is the Sachapin Indian word for \u201csomething sticking down in the water,\u201d in this case the something was a large rock, thought to be a beaver\u2019s heart, and which had an important religious significance for the Palouse Indians.  The Palouse National Forest had its administrative headquarters in the town of Wallace, Idaho for its 15-month existence and was administered by the U.S. Forest Service with 194404 acre .  With the issuance of Executive Order 843 by President Roosevelt on June 26, 1908, with an effective date of July 1, 1908, the entire forest was absorbed by the Coeur d'Alene National Forest and the area ceased to be an independently administered national forest.  The lands of the former Palouse National Forest were then administered as part of the Coeur d\u2019Alene National Forest for three years before being combined with other lands to establish the St. Joe National Forest on July 1, 1911.  The area of the former Palouse National Forest formed the western portion of the St. Joe National Forest.  Once transferred in 1911, the area of the Palouse National Forest became the Palouse Ranger District of the St. Joe National Forest and is still considered part of the St. Joe National Forest.  However, it has been administered by the Clearwater National Forest since the 1973 administrative merger of the Kaniksu National Forest, Coeur d\u2019Alene, and St. Joe National Forests into the Idaho Panhandle National Forests.\n\n## United States National Grassland\n\nNational Grassland is a classification of protected and managed federal lands in the United States authorized by Title III of the Bankhead\u2013Jones Farm Tenant Act of 1937.

The church is a rectangular Tudor Gothic building dedicated in 1847, with an addition in 1865.  The front features two 60 foot flanking octagonal towers are also crenelated and have louvered belfry openings and stained glass Gothic-arched windows.  The parsonage has walls of brick, heavy Tudor-Gothic window hoods, and battlements atop the roof and was built in 1857.  This church was incorporated in 1844 by a group of men from the First Presbyterian Church then located at the northwest corner of East Fayette Street and North Street (now Guilford Avenue) in downtown (later relocated in 1854 to West Madison Street and Park Avenue in Mount Vernon-Belvedere neighborhood after selling their previous third church building of 1790-95 to the Federal Government which built a U.S. Courthouse there [to 1889, replaced again 1932] dedicated in 1860 by President James Buchanan).  They felt the need for a new church in that fast-growing northern section of the city formerly \"Howard's Woods\" of Col. John Eager Howard's (Revolutionary War commander of the famed \"Maryland Line\" regiment of the Continental Army) country estate \"Belvedere\" (mansion located at intersection of North Calvert and East Chase Streets, razed 1875) where the Washington Monument was erected with its four surrounding park squares just two blocks from their new building.  Franklin Street Church was also located on \"Cathedral Hill\" in the southern part of the community bordering downtown and across the street from the old Baltimore Cathedral (Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary) erected 1806-1821 and designed by Benjamin Latrobe.  Later in 1882-1886, philanthropist Enoch Pratt founded his central library for the new Enoch Pratt Free Library then facing West Mulberry Street at Cathedral, a block south which was replaced in 1931-33 by a new central library building encompassing the entire block and now directly across Franklin Street from the F.S.P.C.  In 1973, the two historic congregations reunited to form The First and Franklin Street Presbyterian Church and was centered at the First Church site on West Madison and Park.  The Franklin Street building was used by the merged congregation for a time and then sold to a fundamentalist independent Protestant congregation and later re-sold to the present \"New Unity Church Ministries\".  Across Cathedral Street to the northeast was the 1820s era Greek Revival home designed by Robert Mills (who also did the Washington Monument two blocks away) which later was occupied by the original Maryland Club, an exclusive Southern-leaning dining and leisure society of gentlemen, founded 1857 that was once threatened by Massachusetts Militia Gen. Benjamin F. Butler, U.S.A. when he occupied Baltimore at the beginning of the Civil War on May 13, 1861, and fortified Federal Hill with a Fort and cannons overlooking the harbor and city, \"to put a shot into it\" if he spied a reputed rebel flag flying or any discontent to declared martial law.  The Club later moved to North Charles and East Eager Streets in 1892 and mansion was later replaced by the former Central Building of the Young Men's Christian Association of Central Maryland (YMCA) which was closed in the 1980s and the building renovated as the Mount Vernon Hotel and Cafe.\n\n## First Church of Christ, Scientist (Seattle)\n\nFirst Church of Christ, Scientist Building is an historic Christian Science church located at 1519 East Denny Way / 1841 16th Avenue on the corner of East Denny Way and 16th Avenue in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle, Washington.

Established in August 1896, First Church first held services in various rented buildings or halls until building its first church building on the corner of 6th Avenue and Marion Street.  This was completed in time for its first service on Easter Sunday, April 7, 1901.  This was soon outgrown and in November 1906 a contract was signed to purchase the Denny Way property.
