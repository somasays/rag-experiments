It is a widespread species in West Africa and found in Senegal, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Ivory Coast, as well as in Togo and Benin; it is assumed to occur in Ghana and southeastern Burkina Faso, although it has not been recorded there.  On the other hand, some records may refer to other species; the Amphibian Species of the World excludes Gambia and Togo from the distribution.  Common names Liberia grassland frog and Tournier's rocket frog are sometimes used.\n\n## West Africa\n\nWest Africa, also called Western Africa and the West of Africa, is the westernmost subregion of Africa.  West Africa has been defined as including 18 countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, the island nation of Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, the island of Saint Helena, Senegal, Sierra Leone, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe and Togo.  The population of West Africa is estimated at about /1e6 round 0 million people as of .  Islam is the predominant religion of 70% of the population, with smaller amounts practicing Christianity and Traditional African religions.\n\n## Mohamed Sillah\n\nMohamed Yahya Sillah was born December 12, 1949 in Massam Kpaka, Pujehun District, Republic of Sierra Leone.  His father, Alhaji Yahya Sillah, now 100 years old, served as Regent Chief (Acting Paramount Chief) for several years in Dama Chiefdom, Kenema District in the early seventies.  Alhaji Yahya Sillah was appointed to that high position by Sierra Leone President Siaka Stevens.  His mother, Haja Mamie Zoe Mansaray, was a home maker.  A journalist and human rights activist, Mohamed Yahya Sillah was a vocal torch-bearer in the transition efforts from military to civilian rule in Sierra Leone, 1996.  As Leader and National Chairman of National Alliance Democratic Party (NADP), he competed the 1996 Presidential elections in Sierra Leone, becoming one of only thirteen political leaders that qualified to contest the Presidential and Parliamentary elections in the country at the age of 46.  His adoring personality lured many Sierra Leoneans and media practitioners to view him as one of the most eloquent and charismatic politicians in Sierra Leone.  Nevertheless, he received only 0.5% of the votes (3,723 total votes), good for 13th place.  Although he protested the election results on BBC's Focus on Africa, he later suspended his protest \"for the sake of peace.\"  Mohamed Yahya Sillah continues to enjoy massive support from the youth and women supporters in Sierra Leone.  In 2007, he withdrew his bid for national leadership in the Presidential and Parliamentary elections, citing inadequate funding and ineffective campaign management machinery.  He later put his weight behind the Sierra Leone Peoples Party (SLPP) presidential candidate, Vice President Solomon Berewa.  When Berewa lost the elections, Mohamed Yahya Sillah gracefully congratulated the winning candidate, Ernest Bai Koroma, of the All People's Congress (APC) party.  Mohamed Yahya Sillah vows to respect and help protect the dignity of any Sierra Leonean that is legitimately and democratically elected to office by the people of Sierra Leone.\n\n## Cocoa production in Ivory Coast\n\nIvory Coast (C\u00f4te d'Ivoire) leads the world in production and export of the cocoa beans used in the manufacture of chocolate, as of 2012, supplying 33% of cocoa produced in the world.  West Africa collectively supplies two thirds of the world's cocoa crop, with Ivory Coast leading production at 1.8 million tonnes as of 2017, and nearby Ghana, Nigeria, Cameroon and Togo producing additional 1.55 million tonnes.  Ivory Coast overtook Ghana as the world's leading producer of cocoa beans in 1978, and today is highly dependent on the crop, which accounts for 40% of national export income.  The primary non-African competitor of Ivory Coast is Indonesia, which went from having almost nonexistent domestic cocoa industry in the 1970s to becoming one of the largest producers in the market by the early 2000s.  According to the UN FAO, Indonesia overtook Ghana and became the second-largest producer worldwide in 2006.  (World Cocoa Foundation provides significantly lower figures for Indonesia, but concurs that it is the largest producer of cocoa beans outside West Africa.)  Large chocolate producers such as Cadbury, Hershey's, and Nestle buy Ivorian cocoa futures and options through Euronext whereby world prices are set.\n\n## Saro (Nigeria)\n\nSaros or \"Creoles in Nigeria\" during the nineteenth century and early twentieth century were freed slaves who migrated to Nigeria in the beginning of the 1830s.  They were known locally as saros (elided form of Sierra Leone, from the Yoruba \"s\u00e0r\u00f3\") or Amaros: migrants from Brazil and Cuba.  Saros and Amaros also settled in other West African countries such as the Gold Coast (Ghana).  ",
