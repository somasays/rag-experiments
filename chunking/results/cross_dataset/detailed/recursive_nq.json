The word `` ceramics '' comes from the Greek keramikos ( \u03ba\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 ) , meaning `` pottery '' , which in turn comes from keramos ( \u03ba\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 ) meaning `` potter 's clay '' . Most traditional ceramic products were made from clay ( or clay mixed with other materials ) , shaped and subjected to heat , and tableware and decorative ceramics are generally still made this way . In modern ceramic engineering usage , ceramics is the art and science of making objects from inorganic , non-metallic materials by the action of heat . It excludes glass and mosaic made from glass tesserae . There is a long history of ceramic art in almost all developed cultures , and often ceramic objects are all the artistic evidence left from vanished cultures , like that of the Nok in Africa over 2,000 years ago",
