Constructed by the Suez Canal Company between 1859 and 1869 , it was officially opened on November 17 , 1869 . The canal offers watercraft a shorter journey between the North Atlantic and northern Indian Oceans via the Mediterranean and Red seas by avoiding the South Atlantic and southern Indian oceans , in turn reducing the journey by approximately 7,000 kilometres ( 4,300 mi ) . It extends from the northern terminus of Port Said to the southern terminus of Port Tewfik at the city of Suez . Its length is 193.30 km ( 120.11 mi ) , including its northern and southern access channels . In 2012 , 17,225 vessels traversed the canal ( 47 per day ) . The original canal was a single - lane waterway with passing locations in the Ballah Bypass and the Great Bitter Lake . It contains no locks system , with seawater flowing freely through it . In general , the canal north of the Bitter Lakes flows north in winter and south in summer . South of the lakes , the current changes with the tide at Suez . The canal is owned and maintained by the Suez Canal Authority ( SCA ) of Egypt . Under the Convention of Constantinople , it may be used `` in time of war as in time of peace , by every vessel of commerce or of war , without distinction of flag '' . In August 2014 , construction was launched to expand and widen the Ballah Bypass for 35 km ( 22 mi ) to speed the canal 's transit time . The expansion was planned to double the capacity of the Suez Canal from 49 to 97 ships a day . At a cost of $ 8.4 billion , this project was funded with interest - bearing investment certificates issued exclusively to Egyptian entities and individuals . The `` New Suez Canal '' , as the expansion was dubbed , was opened with great fanfare in a ceremony on 6 August 2015 . On 24 February 2016 , the Suez Canal Authority officially opened the new side channel . This side channel , located at the northern side of the east extension of the Suez Canal , serves the East Terminal for berthing and unberthing vessels from the terminal . As the East Container Terminal is located on the Canal itself , before the construction of the new side channel it was not possible to berth or unberth vessels at the terminal while the convoy was running .",

On November 2 , 2015 , CBS announced a new Star Trek television series to premiere in January 2017 , `` on the heels '' of the original series ' 50th anniversary in 2016 , to be developed specifically for the CBS All Access on demand service . In February 2016 , Bryan Fuller , who began his career writing for the series Star Trek : Deep Space Nine and Star Trek : Voyager , was announced as the new series ' showrunner . Fuller had publicly called for Star Trek to return to television for years , and when he first met with CBS about the series , the company did not have a plan for what the new show would be . He proposed an anthology series with each season being a standalone , serialized show set in a different era , beginning with a prequel to the original series . CBS told Fuller to just start with a single serialized show and see how that performs first , and he began further developing the prequel concept . In June , Fuller announced that the first season would consist of 13 episodes , and a month later , at Star Trek 's 50th anniversary San Diego Comic - Con panel , he revealed the series ' title to be Star Trek : Discovery , and confirmed that it would be set in the `` Prime Timeline '' of the previous Star Trek series . At the end of July , CBS hired David Semel , a veteran television procedural director who was under an overall deal with the studio , to direct the pilot for Discovery . This was a decision that Fuller was not happy with , believing that Semel `` was wrong for the job '' . Fuller wanted a more visionary director , and had personally reached out to Edgar Wright to direct the pilot before CBS hired Semel . As development and pre-production on the series continued , Fuller and Semel `` clashed '' on the direction of the show . The series was also starting to overrun its per - episode budget , while Fuller was attempting to both design new sets , costumes , and aliens as well as heading the series ' writers and also spending considerable time addressing his commitments as showrunner of another new series , American Gods . This caused frustration among CBS executives that were pushing for a January 2017 debut , a date that others believed was unrealistic . By August 2016 , Fuller had hired Gretchen J. Berg and Aaron Harberts , who he had worked with on Pushing Daisies , to serve as co-showrunners with him . A month later , Fuller and Kurtzman had asked CBS to delay the series ' release so they could realistically meet the high expectations for the series , and the studio announced that the series premiere had been pushed back to May 2017 . The pair said that `` these extra few months will help us achieve a vision we can all be proud of . '' A few weeks after the delay , Fuller met with Sonequa Martin - Green about portraying the series ' lead , a character that had been surprisingly difficult for the production to cast . Fuller `` felt he found the crucial piece of the puzzle '' , but the actress would not be released from a contract at AMC until her character 's death on The Walking Dead which was not set to air until April 2017 , meaning Discovery would have to be delayed again if Martin - Green was cast .",

The name Beijing , which means `` Northern Capital '' ( from the Chinese characters \u5317 for north and \u4eac for capital ) , was applied to the city in 1403 during the Ming dynasty to distinguish the city from Nanjing ( the `` Southern Capital '' ) . The English spelling is based on the pinyin romanization of the two characters as they are pronounced in Standard Mandarin . An older English spelling , Peking , is the postal romanization of the same two characters as they are pronounced in Chinese dialects spoken in the southern port towns first visited by European traders and missionaries . Those dialects preserve the Middle Chinese pronunciation of \u4eac as kjaeng , prior to a phonetic shift in the northern dialects to the modern pronunciation . Although Peking is no longer the common name for the city , some of the city 's older locations and facilities , such as Beijing Capital International Airport , with IATA Code PEK , and Peking University , still use the former romanization . The single Chinese character abbreviation for Beijing is \u4eac , which appears on automobile license plates in the city . The official Latin alphabet abbreviation for Beijing is `` BJ '' . History Main article : History of Beijing Early History The earliest traces of human habitation in the Beijing municipality were found in the caves of Dragon Bone Hill near the village of Zhoukoudian in Fangshan District , where Peking Man lived . Homo erectus fossils from the caves date to 230,000 to 250,000 years ago . Paleolithic Homo sapiens also lived there more recently , about 27,000 years ago . Archaeologists have found neolithic settlements throughout the municipality , including in Wangfujing , located in downtown Beijing . The first walled city in Beijing was Jicheng , the capital city of the state of Ji and was built in 1045 BC . Within modern Beijing , Jicheng was located around the present Guang'anmen area in the south of Xicheng District . This settlement was later conquered by the state of Yan and made its capital . Early Imperial China The Tianning Pagoda , built around 1120 during the Liao dynasty . After the First Emperor unified China , Jicheng became a prefectural capital for the region . During the Three Kingdoms period , it was held by Gongsun Zan and Yuan Shao before falling to Cao Cao 's Wei Kingdom .",

Early Imperial China The Tianning Pagoda , built around 1120 during the Liao dynasty . After the First Emperor unified China , Jicheng became a prefectural capital for the region . During the Three Kingdoms period , it was held by Gongsun Zan and Yuan Shao before falling to Cao Cao 's Wei Kingdom . The AD 3rd - century Western Jin demoted the town , placing the prefectural seat in neighboring Zhuozhou . During the Sixteen Kingdoms period when northern China was conquered and divided by the Wu Hu , Jicheng was briefly the capital of the Xianbei Former Yan Kingdom . After China was reunified during the Sui dynasty , Jicheng , also known as Zhuojun , became the northern terminus of the Grand Canal . Under the Tang dynasty , Jicheng as Youzhou , served as a military frontier command center . During the An - Shi Rebellion and again amidst the turmoil of the late Tang , local military commanders founded their own short - lived Yan dynasties and called the city Yanjing , or the `` Yan Capital . '' Also in the Tang dynasty , the city 's name Jicheng was replaced by Youzhou or Yanjing . In 938 , after the fall of the Tang , the Later Jin ceded the entire northern frontier to the Khitan Liao dynasty , which treated the city as Nanjing , or the `` Southern Capital '' , one of four secondary capitals to complement its `` Supreme Capital '' , Shangjing ( modern Baarin Left Banner in Inner Mongolia ) . Some of the oldest surviving structures in Beijing date to the Liao period , including the Tianning Pagoda . Miaoying Temple and its White Stupa in Dadu which was built by Kublai Khan The Liao fell to the Jurchen Jin dynasty in 1122 , which gave the city to the Song dynasty and then retook it in 1125 during its conquest of northern China . In 1153 , the Jurchen Jin made Beijing their `` Central Capital '' , or Zhongdu . The city was besieged by Genghis Khan 's invading Mongolian army in 1213 and razed to the ground two years later . Two generations later , Kublai Khan ordered the construction of Dadu ( or Daidu to the Mongols , commonly known as Khanbaliq ) , a new capital for his Yuan dynasty to the northeast of the Zhongdu ruins . The construction took from 1264 to 1293 , but greatly enhanced the status of a city on the northern fringe of China proper . The city was centered on the Drum Tower slightly to the north of modern Beijing and stretched from the present - day Chang'an Avenue to the northern part of Line 10 subway . Remnants of the Yuan rammed earth wall still stand and are known as the Tucheng . Ming dynasty One of the corner towers of the Forbidden City , which was built by Emperor Yongle in Ming dynasty . In 1368 , soon after declaring the new Hongwu era of the Ming dynasty , the rebel leader Zhu Yuanzhang sent an army to Khanbaliq and conquered it . Since the Yuan continued to occupy Shangdu and Mongolia , however , Dadu was renamed to Beiping as used to supply the military garrisons in the area . And under the Hongwu Emperor 's feudal policies it was given to Zhu Di , one of his sons , who was created `` Prince of Yan '' . The early death of Zhu Yuanzhang 's heir led to a succession struggle on his death , one that ended with the victory of Zhu Di and the declaration of the new Yongle era . Since his harsh treatment of the Ming capital Yingtian ( modern Nanjing ) alienated many there , he established his fief as a new co-capital . The city of Beiping became Beijing ( northern capital ) or Shuntian in 1403 . The construction of the new imperial residence , the Forbidden City , took from 1406 to 1420 ; this period was also responsible for several other of the modern city 's major attractions , such as the Temple of Heaven and Tian'anmen .",

How would you know if he was going to be the warrior that would protect you at all costs , if he was n't your lover ? '' A 2012 poll by Gallup found that Hawaii had the largest proportion of lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ( LGBT ) adults in the U.S. , at 5.1 % , comprising an estimated adult LGBT population of 53,966 individuals . The number of same - sex couple households in 2010 was 3,239 ; a 35.5 % increase of figures from a decade earlier . In 2013 , Hawaii became the fifteenth U.S. state to legalize same - sex marriage ; a University of Hawaii researcher said the law may boost tourism by $217 million . Economy See also : Hawaii locations by per capita income Post-annexation , Hawaii 's economy and demographic changes were shaped mostly by the agricultural sector 's growth . From the end of World War II onwards , depictions and photographs , such as this , of Hawaii as a tropical , leisure paradise encouraged the growth of tourism in Hawaii , which eventually became the largest industry of the islands . The U.S. federal government 's spending on Hawaii - stationed personnel , installations and materiel , either directly or through military personnel spending , amounts to Hawaii 's second largest source of income , after tourism . The history of Hawaii 's economy can be traced through a succession of dominant industries ; sandalwood , whaling , sugarcane , pineapple , the military , tourism and education . Since statehood in 1959 , tourism has been the largest industry , contributing 24.3 % of the gross state product ( GSP ) in 1997 , despite efforts to diversify . The state 's gross output for 2003 was US $47 billion ; per capita income for Hawaii residents in 2014 was US $54,516 . Hawaiian exports include food and clothing . These industries play a small role in the Hawaiian economy , due to the shipping distance to viable markets , such as the West Coast of the contiguous U.S. The state 's food exports include coffee , macadamia nuts , pineapple , livestock , sugarcane and honey . By weight , honey bees may be the state 's most valuable export . According to the Hawaii Agricultural Statistics Service , agricultural sales were US $370.9 million from diversified agriculture , US $100.6 million from pineapple , and US $64.3 million from sugarcane . Hawaii 's relatively consistent climate has attracted the seed industry , which is able to test three generations of crops per year on the islands , compared with one or two on the mainland . Seeds yielded US $264 million in 2012 , supporting 1,400 workers . As of December 2015 , the state 's unemployment rate was 3.2 % . In 2009 , the United States military spent US $12.2 billion in Hawaii , accounting for 18 % of spending in the state for that year . 75,000 United States Department of Defense personnel live in Hawaii . According to a 2013 study by Phoenix Marketing International , Hawaii had the fourth - largest number of millionaires per capita in the United States , with a ratio of 7.2 % . Taxation Hawaii residents pay the most per person in state taxes in the United States . Millions of tourists pay general excise tax and hotel room tax . The Hawaii Tax Foundation considers the state 's tax burden too high , which it says contributes to higher prices and the perception of an unfriendly business climate . State Senator Sam Slom says state taxes are comparatively higher than other states because the state government handles education , health care , and social services that are usually handled at a county or municipal level in most other states . Cost of living The cost of living in Hawaii , specifically Honolulu , is high compared to that of most major U.S. cities , although it is 6.7 % lower than in New York City and 3.6 % lower than in San Francisco .",

The U.S. Senate never ratified the treaty . Despite the opposition of most native Hawaiians , the Newlands Resolution was used to annex the Republic to the U.S. ; it became the Territory of Hawaii . The Newlands Resolution was passed by the House on June 15 , 1898 , by 209 votes in favor to 91 against , and by the Senate on July 6 , 1898 , by a vote of 42 to 21 . In 1900 , Hawaii was granted self - governance and retained \u02bbIolani Palace as the territorial capitol building . Despite several attempts to become a state , Hawaii remained a territory for 60 years . Plantation owners and capitalists , who maintained control through financial institutions such as the Big Five , found territorial status convenient because they remained able to import cheap , foreign labor . Such immigration and labor practices were prohibited in many states . The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 was the primary event that galvanized the United States into entering World War II . Puerto Rican immigration to Hawaii began in 1899 , when Puerto Rico 's sugar industry was devastated by two hurricanes , causing a worldwide shortage of sugar and a huge demand for sugar from Hawaii . Hawaiian sugarcane plantation owners began to recruit experienced , unemployed laborers in Puerto Rico . Two waves of Korean immigration to Hawaii occurred in the 20th century . The first wave arrived between 1903 and 1924 ; the second wave began in 1965 after President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 , which removed racial and national barriers and resulted in significantly altering the demographic mix in the U.S. O\u02bbahu was the target of a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor by Imperial Japan on December 7 , 1941 . The attack on Pearl Harbor and other military and naval installations , carried out by aircraft and by midget submarines , brought the United States into World War II . Political changes of 1954 -- the state of Hawaii ( 1959 -- present ) Main article : Democratic Revolution of 1954 ( Hawaii ) See also : List of Hawaiian sovereignty movement groups \u00a7 Modern -- Sovereignty Organizations ( 1960s -- present ) Prior to the postwar labor movement , Hawaii was governed by plantation owners . Here , three young women pack pineapples into cans in 1928 . In the 1950s , the power of the plantation owners was broken by the descendants of immigrant laborers , who were born in Hawaii and were U.S. citizens . They voted against the Hawaii Republican Party , strongly supported by plantation owners . The new majority voted for the Democratic Party of Hawaii , which dominated territorial and state politics for more than 40 years . Eager to gain full representation in Congress and the Electoral College , residents actively campaigned for statehood . In Washington there was talk that Hawaii would be a Republican Party stronghold so it was matched with the admission of Alaska , seen as a Democratic Party stronghold . These predictions turned out to be inaccurate ; today , Hawaii votes Democratic predominately , while Alaska votes Republican . In March 1959 , Congress passed the Hawaii Admission Act , which U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed into law . The act excluded Palmyra Atoll from statehood ; it had been part of the Kingdom and Territory of Hawaii . On June 27 , 1959 , a referendum asked residents of Hawaii to vote on the statehood bill ; 94.3 % voted in favor of statehood and 5.7 % opposed it . The referendum asked voters to choose between accepting the Act and remaining a U.S. territory . The United Nations ' Special Committee on Decolonization later removed Hawaii from its list of non-self - governing territories . After attaining statehood , Hawaii quickly modernized through construction and a rapidly growing tourism economy . Later , state programs promoted Hawaiian culture . The Hawaii State Constitutional Convention of 1978 created institutions such as the Office of Hawaiian Affairs to promote indigenous language and culture . Demographics Population Population density map of the Hawaiian islands See also : Hawaii statistical areas After Europeans and mainland Americans first arrived during the Kingdom of Hawaii period , the overall population of Hawaii , until that time composed solely of indigenous Hawaiians , fell dramatically . The indigenous Hawaiian population succumbed to foreign diseases , declining from 300,000 in the 1770s , to 60,000 in the 1850s , to 24,000 in 1920 .",

Cost of living The cost of living in Hawaii , specifically Honolulu , is high compared to that of most major U.S. cities , although it is 6.7 % lower than in New York City and 3.6 % lower than in San Francisco . These numbers may not take into account some costs , such as increased travel costs for flights , additional shipping fees , and the loss of promotional participation opportunities for customers outside the contiguous U.S. While some online stores offer free shipping on orders to Hawaii , many merchants exclude Hawaii , Alaska , Puerto Rico and certain other U.S. territories . Hawaiian Electric Industries , a privately owned company , provides 95 % of the state 's population with electricity , mostly from fossil - fuel power stations . Average electricity prices in October 2014 ( 36.41 cents per kilowatt - hour ) were nearly three times the national average ( 12.58 cents per kilowatt - hour ) and 80 % higher than the second - highest state , Connecticut . The median home value in Hawaii in the 2000 U.S. Census was US $272,700 , while the national median home value was US $119,600 . Hawaii home values were the highest of all states , including California with a median home value of US $211,500 . Research from the National Association of Realtors places the 2010 median sale price of a single family home in Honolulu , Hawaii , at US $607,600 and the U.S. median sales price at US $173,200 . The sale price of single family homes in Hawaii was the highest of any U.S. city in 2010 , just above that of the Silicon Valley area of California ( US $602,000 ) . Hawaii 's very high cost of living is the result of several interwoven factors of the global economy in addition to domestic U.S. government trade policy . Like other regions with desirable weather throughout the year , such as areas of California , Arizona and Florida , Hawaii 's residents can be considered to be subject to a `` Sunshine tax '' . This situation is further exacerbated by the natural factors of geography and world distribution that lead to higher prices for goods due to increased shipping costs , a problem which many island states and territories suffer from as well . The situation is compounded even further by what could possibly be the single largest contributor to the high costs of living in Hawaii , a U.S. trade law known as the Jones Act , or the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 . This trade regulation prohibits any foreign - flagged ships from carrying cargo between two American ports -- a practice known as cabotage . Most consumer goods in the United States are manufactured by outsourced labor in East Asia , then transported by container ships to ports on the U.S. mainland , and Hawaii also receives the same goods . Being located in the central Pacific Ocean , right between major Pacific shipping lanes , it would be very economical to unload Hawaiian - bound goods in Honolulu , before continuing on to the mainland . However , this would effectively make the second leg of the voyage between Hawaii and the mainland a domestic route between two American ports . Because most large cargo ships operate under foreign `` flags of convenience '' such as Liberia , Vanuatu or Papua New Guinea , allowing them to avoid the more stringent , and thus more costly , regulations of developed nations ' ports , the domestic leg of the voyage would be disallowed by the Jones Act . Instead , those cargo ships must proceed directly to the West Coast , where distributors break bulk and transport the Hawaiian - bound , Asian - manufactured goods back across the ocean by U.S. - flagged ships and increasing the length of the voyage by more than 50 % . This highly inefficient system of shipping Hawaii 's consumer cargo comes at a very hefty price for the average Hawaiian citizen , and makes the cost of living in Hawaii much , much higher than it would otherwise be . Hawaiian consumers ultimately bear the expense of transporting goods imposed by the Jones Act . This law makes Hawaii less competitive than West Coast ports as a shopping destination for tourists from countries with much higher taxes like Japan , even though prices for Asian - manufactured goods should be cheaper because Hawaii is much closer than mainland states to Asia .",

For the later seasons , its creators see Game of Thrones as an adaptation of A Song of Ice and Fire as a whole rather than the individual novels ; this enables them to move events across novels , according to screen - adaptation requirements . Filming The Azure Window at Ras - id - Dwerja , on Gozo , was the site of the Dothraki wedding in season one . Principal photography for the first season was scheduled to begin on July 26 , 2010 , and the primary location was the Paint Hall Studios in Belfast , Northern Ireland . Exterior scenes in Northern Ireland were filmed at Sandy Brae in the Mourne Mountains ( standing in for Vaes Dothrak ) , Castle Ward ( Winterfell ) , Saintfield Estates ( the Winterfell godswood ) , Tollymore Forest ( outdoor scenes ) , Cairncastle ( the execution site ) , the Magheramorne quarry ( Castle Black ) and Shane 's Castle ( the tourney grounds ) .

Alan Taylor has directed seven episodes , the most episodes of the series . Alex Graves , David Nutter , Mark Mylod and Jeremy Podeswa have directed six each . Daniel Minahan directed five episodes , and Michelle MacLaren , Alik Sakharov , and Miguel Sapochnik directed four each . Brian Kirk directed three episodes during the first season , and Tim Van Patten directed the series ' first two episodes . Neil Marshall directed two episodes , both with large battle scenes : `` Blackwater '' and `` The Watchers on the Wall '' . Other directors have been Jack Bender , David Petrarca , Daniel Sackheim , Michael Slovis and Matt Shakman . David Benioff and D.B. Weiss have directed two episodes together but only credited one each episode , which was determined after a coin toss . Technical aspects Alik Sakharov was the pilot 's cinematographer . The series has had a number of cinematographers , and has received seven Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Cinematography for a Single - Camera Series nominations . Oral Norrey Ottey , Frances Parker , Martin Nicholson , Crispin Green , Tim Porter and Katie Weiland have edited the series for a varying number of episodes . Weiland received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Single - Camera Picture Editing for a Drama Series in 2015 . Costumes The costumes of Ygritte , Jon Snow and Tormund Giantsbane reflect the harsh climate in which they are worn . Dresses worn at the royal court in King 's Landing indicate their wearers ' wealth and status . Functional weapons and armor , like Brienne of Tarth 's ( left ) , were manufactured for the series . Michele Clapton was costume designer for Game of Thrones ' first five seasons before she was replaced by April Ferry . Clapton will return to the show as costume designer for the seventh season . The costumes used in the show drew inspiration from a number of sources , such as Japanese and Persian armour . Dothraki dress resembles that of the Bedouin ( one was made out of fish skins to resemble dragon scales ) , and the Wildlings wear animal skins like the Inuit . Wildling bone armor is made from molds of actual bones , and is assembled with string and latex resembling catgut . Although the extras who play Wildlings and the Night 's Watch often wear hats ( normal in a cold climate ) , members of the principal cast usually do not so viewers can distinguish the main characters . Bj\u00f6rk 's Alexander McQueen high - neckline dresses inspired Margaery Tyrell 's funnel - neck outfit , and prostitutes ' dresses are designed for easy removal . All clothing used is aged for two weeks so it appears realistic on high - definition television . About two dozen wigs are used for the actresses . Made of human hair and up to 2 feet ( 61 cm ) in length , they cost up to $7,000 each and are washed and styled like real hair . Applying the wigs is time - consuming ; Emilia Clarke , for example , requires about two hours to style her brunette hair with a platinum - blonde wig and braids . Other actors , such as Jack Gleeson and Sophie Turner , receive frequent hair coloring . For characters such as Daenerys ( Clarke ) and her Dothraki , their hair , wigs and costumes are processed to appear as if they have not been washed for weeks . Makeup For the first three seasons , Paul Engelen was Game of Thrones ' main makeup designer and prosthetic makeup artist with Melissa Lackersteen , Conor O'Sullivan and Rob Trenton . At the beginning of the fourth season Engelen 's team was replaced by Jane Walker and her crew , composed of Ann McEwan and Barrie and Sarah Gower . Visual Effects For the series ' large number of visual effects , HBO hired British - based BlueBolt and Irish - based Screen Scene for season one . Most of the environment builds were done as 2.5 D projections , giving viewers perspective while keeping the programming from being overwhelming . In 2011 the season - one finale , `` Fire and Blood '' , was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Visual Effects . Because the effects became more complex in subsequent seasons ( including CGI creatures , fire , and water ) , German - based Pixomondo became the lead visual - effects producer ; nine of its twelve facilities contributed to the project for season two , with Stuttgart the lead .",

The Turtles started their rise to mainstream success when a licensing agent , Mark Freedman , sought out Eastman and Laird to propose wider merchandising opportunities for the franchise . In 1986 , Dark Horse Miniatures produced a set of 15 - mm ( approximately 0.6 inch ) lead figurines . In January 1987 , Eastman and Laird visited the offices of Playmates Toys , a small California toy company that wanted to expand into the action - figure market . Development was undertaken by a creative team of companies and individuals : Jerry Sachs , advertising agent of Sachs - Finley Agency , brought together the animators at Murakami - Wolf - Swenson headed by Fred Wolf . Wolf and his team combined concepts and ideas with the Playmates marketing crew , headed by Karl Aaronian , vice president ( VP ) of sales Richard Sallis , and VP of Playmates Bill Carlson . Aaronian brought on several designers and concepteur and writer John C. Schulte , and worked out the simple backstory that would live on toy packaging for the entire run of the product and show . Sachs called the high concept pitch `` Green Against Brick '' . The sense of humor was honed with the collaboration of the Murakami - Wolf - Swenson animation firm 's writers . Playmates and their team essentially served as associate producers and contributing writers to the miniseries that was first launched to sell - in the toy action figures . Phrases like `` Heroes in a half shell '' and many of the comical catch phrases and battle cries ( `` Turtle power ! '' ) came from the writing and conceptualization of this creative team . As the series developed , veteran writer Jack Mendelsohn came on board as both a story editor and scriptwriter . David Wise , Michael Charles Hill , and Michael Reaves wrote most of the scripts . The miniseries was repeated three times before it found an audience . Once the product started selling , the show got syndicated and picked up and backed by Group W , which funded the next round of animation . The show then went network , on CBS . Accompanied by the popular Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 1987 TV series , and the subsequent action figure line , Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles became a mainstream success . At the height of the frenzy , in the late 1980s and early 1990s , the Turtles ' likenesses could be found on a wide range of children 's merchandise , from Pez dispensers to skateboards , breakfast cereal , video games , school supplies , linens , towels , cameras , and toy shaving kits . While the animated TV series , which lasted for 10 seasons until 1996 , was more light - hearted , the comic - book series continued in a much darker and grittier tone . In 1990 , a live - action feature film was released , with the Turtles and Splinter being portrayed by actors in partially animatronic suits created by Jim Henson 's Creature Shop . The film became one of the most successful independent films and spawned two sequels , as well as inspiring a three - dimensional animated film set in the same continuity , which was released in 2007 under the title TMNT . After the end of the cartoon series , a live - action series in the vein of the films was created in 1997 in conjunction with Saban Entertainment . The series was called Ninja Turtles : The Next Mutation and introduced a fifth , female turtle called Venus de Milo . However , the series was largely unsuccessful and was canceled after one season . The property lay dormant until 2003 , when a new animated TV series also entitled Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles began to air on Fox Box ( 4Kids TV ) . The series storyline stuck much closer to the original Mirage comic book series , but was still less violent . It lasted for seven seasons and 156 episodes , ending in February 2009 . On October 21 , 2009 , it was announced that cable channel Nickelodeon ( a subsidiary of Viacom ) had purchased all of Mirage 's rights to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles property . Mirage retains the rights to publish 18 issues a year , though the future involvement of Mirage with the Turtles and the future of Mirage Studios itself is unknown . Nickelodeon has developed a new CGI - animated TMNT television series and partnered with fellow Viacom company Paramount Pictures to bring a new TMNT movie to theaters .

They were trained by their anthropomorphic rat sensei in the art of ninjutsu . From their home in the sewers of New York City , they battle petty criminals , evil overlords , mutated creatures , and alien invaders while attempting to remain hidden from society . They were created by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird . The characters originated in comic books published by Mirage Studios and expanded into cartoon series , films , video games , toys , and other merchandise . During the peak of the franchise 's popularity in the late 1980s and early 1990s , it gained worldwide success and fame .

The concept arose from a humorous drawing sketched out by Eastman during a casual evening of brainstorming and bad television with Laird . Using money from a tax refund , together with a loan from Eastman 's uncle , the young artists self - published a single - issue comic intended to parody four of the most popular comics of the early 1980s : Marvel Comics ' Daredevil and New Mutants , Dave Sim 's Cerebus , and Frank Miller 's Ronin .

It featured an adventure story Monday through Friday and activity puzzles on weekends ( with fan art appearing later ) . The comic strip was published in syndication until its cancellation in December 1996 . At its highest point in popularity , it was published in over 250 newspapers . Television series ( edit ) First animated series ( 1987 -- 1996 ) ( edit ) Main article : Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles ( 1987 TV series ) Logo of the 1987 cartoon When little - known Playmates Toys , Inc. was approached about producing a TMNTs action figure line , they were cautious of the risk and requested that a television deal be acquired first . On December 28 , 1987 , the TMNT 's first cartoon series began , starting as a five - part miniseries and becoming a regular Saturday - morning syndicated series on October 1 , 1988 , with 13 more episodes . The series was produced by Murakami - Wolf - Swenson Film Productions , Inc. ( later Fred Wolf Films ) . Mirage Studios does not own the rights to this cartoon series . The show places a much stronger emphasis on humor than the comics do . Here , the Ninja Turtles are portrayed as four wise - cracking , pizza - obsessed superheroes that fight the forces of evil from their sewer hideout , and they make their first appearance in masks color - coded to each turtle , where previously they had all worn red . The cast included new and different characters , such as Bebop and Rocksteady and the Neutrinos . Original characters such as Splinter , Shredder , and the Foot Soldiers stayed true to the comics in appearance and alignment only . Instead of being Hamato Yoshi 's mutated pet rat , Splinter was a mutated Hamato himself . The Foot Soldiers changed from human ninjas to an endless supply of robotic grunts , allowing large numbers of them to be destroyed without anyone dying ( this was a very important decision in terms of the show 's child audience ; excessive violence would have alienated parents of children , the show 's target demographic ) . Krang , one of the series ' most memorable villains , was inspired by the design of the Utrom , a benign alien race from the Mirage comics .",

          "full_text": "The European nations declared war on one another in 1756 following months of localized conflict , escalating the war from a regional affair into an intercontinental conflict . The name French and Indian War is used mainly in the United States . It refers to the two main enemies of the British colonists : the royal French forces and the various American Indian forces allied with them . The British colonists were supported at various times by the Iroquois , Catawba , and Cherokee , and the French colonists were supported by Wabanaki Confederacy members Abenaki and Mi'kmaq , and Algonquin , Lenape , Ojibwa , Ottawa , Shawnee , and Wyandot . British and other European historians use the term the Seven Years ' War , as do English - speaking Canadians . French Canadians call it La guerre de la Conqu\u00eate ( the War of the Conquest ) or ( rarely ) the Fourth Intercolonial War . Fighting took place primarily along the frontiers between New France and the British colonies , from Virginia in the south to Newfoundland in the north . It began with a dispute over control of the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers called the Forks of the Ohio , and the site of the French Fort Duquesne within present - day Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . The dispute erupted into violence in the Battle of Jumonville Glen in May 1754 , during which Virginia militiamen under the command of 22 - year - old George Washington ambushed a French patrol . In 1755 , six colonial governors in North America met with General Edward Braddock , the newly arrived British Army commander , and planned a four - way attack on the French . None succeeded , and the main effort by Braddock proved a disaster ; he lost the Battle of the Monongahela on July 9 , 1755 and died a few days later . British operations failed in the frontier areas of Pennsylvania and New York during 1755 -- 57 due to a combination of poor management , internal divisions , effective Canadian scouts , French regular forces , and Indian warrior allies . In 1755 , the British captured Fort Beaus\u00e9jour on the border separating Nova Scotia from Acadia , and they ordered the expulsion of the Acadians ( 1755 -- 64 ) soon afterwards . Orders for the deportation were given by William Shirley , Commander - in - Chief , North America , without direction from Great Britain . The Acadians were expelled , both those captured in arms and those who had sworn the loyalty oath to His Britannic Majesty . Indians likewise were driven off the land to make way for settlers from New England . The British colonial government fell in the region of modern Nova Scotia after several disastrous campaigns in 1757 , including a failed expedition against Louisbourg and the Siege of Fort William Henry ; this last was followed by Indians torturing and massacring their British victims . William Pitt came to power and significantly increased British military resources in the colonies at a time when France was unwilling to risk large convoys to aid the limited forces that they had in New France , preferring to concentrate their forces against Prussia and its allies in the European theater of the war . Between 1758 and 1760 , the British military launched a campaign to capture the Colony of Canada ( part of New France ) . They succeeded in capturing territory in surrounding colonies and ultimately the city of Quebec ( 1759 ) . The British later lost the Battle of Sainte - Foy west of Quebec ( 1760 ) , but the French ceded Canada in accordance with the Treaty of Paris ( 1763 ) . The outcome was one of the most significant developments in a century of Anglo - French conflict . France ceded to Great Britain its territory east of the Mississippi . It ceded French Louisiana west of the Mississippi River ( including New Orleans ) to its ally Spain in compensation for Spain 's loss to Britain of Florida . ( Spain had ceded Florida to Britain in exchange for the return of Havana , Cuba . ) France 's colonial presence north of the Caribbean was reduced to the islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon , confirming Great Britain 's position as the dominant colonial power in eastern North America .",

The British colonists were supported at various times by the Iroquois , Catawba , and Cherokee , and the French colonists were supported by Wabanaki Confederacy members Abenaki and Mi'kmaq , and Algonquin , Lenape , Ojibwa , Ottawa , Shawnee , and Wyandot . British and other European historians use the term the Seven Years ' War , as do English - speaking Canadians . French Canadians call it La guerre de la Conqu\u00eate ( the War of the Conquest ) or ( rarely ) the Fourth Intercolonial War .",

The French population numbered about 75,000 and was heavily concentrated along the St. Lawrence River valley , with some also in Acadia ( present - day New Brunswick and parts of Nova Scotia ) , including \u00cele Royale ( present - day Cape Breton Island ) . Fewer lived in New Orleans , Biloxi , Mississippi , Mobile , Alabama , and small settlements in the Illinois Country , hugging the east side of the Mississippi River and its tributaries . French fur traders and trappers traveled throughout the St. Lawrence and Mississippi watersheds , did business with local Indian tribes , and often married Indian women . Traders married daughters of chiefs , creating high - ranking unions . British settlers outnumbered the French 20 to 1 with a population of about 1.5 million ranged along the eastern coast of the continent from Nova Scotia and Newfoundland in the north to Georgia in the south . Many of the older colonies had land claims that extended arbitrarily far to the west , as the extent of the continent was unknown at the time when their provincial charters were granted . Their population centers were along the coast , yet the settlements were growing into the interior . Nova Scotia had been captured from France in 1713 , and it still had a significant French - speaking population . Britain also claimed Rupert 's Land where the Hudson 's Bay Company traded for furs with local Indian tribes . Iroquois engaging in trade with colonists , 1722 In between the French and British colonists , large areas were dominated by Indian tribes . To the north , the Mi'kmaqs and the Abenakis were engaged in Father Le Loutre 's War and still held sway in parts of Nova Scotia , Acadia , and the eastern portions of the province of Canada , as well as much of Maine . The Iroquois Confederation dominated much of Upstate New York and the Ohio Country , although Ohio also included Algonquian - speaking populations of Delaware and Shawnee , as well as Iroquoian - speaking Mingos . These tribes were formally under Iroquois rule and were limited by them in their authority to make agreements . The Southeast interior was dominated by Siouan - speaking Catawbas , Muskogee - speaking Creeks and Choctaw , and the Iroquoian - speaking Cherokee tribes . When war broke out , the French colonists used their trading connections to recruit fighters from tribes in western portions of the Great Lakes region , which was not directly subject to the conflict between the French and British ; these included the Hurons , Mississaugs , Ojibwas , Winnebagos , and Potawatomi . The British colonists were supported in the war by the Iroquois Six Nations and also by the Cherokees , until differences sparked the Anglo - Cherokee War in 1758 . In 1758 , the Pennsylvania government successfully negotiated the Treaty of Easton in which a number of tribes in the Ohio Country promised neutrality in exchange for land concessions and other considerations . Most of the other northern tribes sided with the French , their primary trading partner and supplier of arms . The Creeks and Cherokees were subject to diplomatic efforts by both the French and British to gain either their support or neutrality in the conflict . New York and Pennsylvania theaters of the war , image from 1905 By this time , Spain claimed only the province of Florida in eastern North America ; it controlled Cuba and other territories in the West Indies that became military objectives in the Seven Years ' War . Florida 's European population was a few hundred , concentrated in St. Augustine and Pensacola . At the start of the war , no French regular army troops were stationed in North America , and few British troops . New France was defended by about 3,000 troupes de la marine , companies of colonial regulars ( some of whom had significant woodland combat experience ) . The colonial government recruited militia support when needed . Most British colonies mustered local militia companies to deal with Indian threats , generally ill trained and available only for short periods , but they did not have any standing forces . Virginia , by contrast , had a large frontier with several companies of British regulars . The colonial governments were used to operating independently of one another and of the government in London , a situation that complicated negotiations with Indian tribes , whose territories often encompassed land claimed by multiple colonies . After the war began , the leaders of the British Army establishment tried to impose constraints and demands on the colonial administrations .",

For example , she refuses to wear frilly clothes , saying that Aunt Alexandra 's `` fanatical '' attempts to place her in them made her feel `` a pink cotton penitentiary closing in on ( her ) '' . Johnson states , `` ( t ) he novel is a study of how Jem and Scout begin to perceive the complexity of social codes and how the configuration of relationships dictated by or set off by those codes fails or nurtures the inhabitants of ( their ) small worlds . '' Loss of innocence Lee used the mockingbird to symbolize innocence in the novel Songbirds and their associated symbolism appear throughout the novel . Their family name Finch is also Lee 's mother 's maiden name . The titular mockingbird is a key motif of this theme , which first appears when Atticus , having given his children air - rifles for Christmas , allows their Uncle Jack to teach them to shoot . Atticus warns them that , although they can `` shoot all the bluejays they want '' , they must remember that `` it 's a sin to kill a mockingbird '' . Confused , Scout approaches her neighbor Miss Maudie , who explains that mockingbirds never harm other living creatures . She points out that mockingbirds simply provide pleasure with their songs , saying , `` They do n't do one thing but sing their hearts out for us . '' Writer Edwin Bruell summarized the symbolism when he wrote in 1964 , `` ' To kill a mockingbird ' is to kill that which is innocent and harmless -- like Tom Robinson . '' Scholars have noted that Lee often returns to the mockingbird theme when trying to make a moral point . Tom Robinson is the chief example among several innocents destroyed carelessly or deliberately throughout the novel . However , scholar Christopher Metress connects the mockingbird to Boo Radley : `` Instead of wanting to exploit Boo for her own fun ( as she does in the beginning of the novel by putting on gothic plays about his history ) , Scout comes to see him as a ' mockingbird ' -- that is , as someone with an inner goodness that must be cherished . '' The last pages of the book illustrate this as Scout relates the moral of a story Atticus has been reading to her , and , in allusions to both Boo Radley and Tom Robinson , states about a character who was misunderstood , `` when they finally saw him , why he had n't done any of those things ... Atticus , he was real nice , '' to which he responds , `` Most people are , Scout , when you finally see them . '' The novel exposes the loss of innocence so frequently that reviewer R.A. Dave claims that because every character has to face , or even suffer defeat , the book takes on elements of a classical tragedy . In exploring how each character deals with his or her own personal defeat , Lee builds a framework to judge whether the characters are heroes or fools . She guides the reader in such judgments , alternating between unabashed adoration and biting irony . Scout 's experience with the Missionary Society is an ironic juxtaposition of women who mock her , gossip , and `` reflect a smug , colonialist attitude toward other races '' while giving the `` appearance of gentility , piety , and morality '' . Conversely , when Atticus loses Tom 's case , he is last to leave the courtroom , except for his children and the black spectators in the colored balcony , who rise silently as he walks underneath them , to honor his efforts . Reception Despite her editors ' warnings that the book might not sell well , it quickly became a sensation , bringing acclaim to Lee in literary circles , in her hometown of Monroeville , and throughout Alabama . The book went through numerous subsequent printings and became widely available through its inclusion in the Book of the Month Club and editions released by Reader 's Digest Condensed Books . Initial reactions to the novel were varied . The New Yorker declared Lee `` a skilled , unpretentious , and totally ingenuous writer '' , and The Atlantic Monthly 's reviewer rated the book `` pleasant , undemanding reading '' , but found the narrative voice -- `` a six - year - old girl with the prose style of a well - educated adult '' -- to be implausible . Time magazine 's 1960 review of the book states that it `` teaches the reader an astonishing number of useful truths about little girls and about Southern life '' and calls Scout Finch `` the most appealing child since Carson McCullers ' Frankie got left behind at the wedding '' . The Chicago Sunday Tribune noted the even - handed approach to the narration of the novel 's events , writing : `` This is in no way a sociological novel .",

To Kill a Mockingbird First edition cover -- late printing Author Harper Lee Country United States Language English Genre Southern Gothic , Bildungsroman Published July 11 , 1960 Publisher J.B. Lippincott & Co . Pages 281 To Kill a Mockingbird is a novel by Harper Lee published in 1960 . It was immediately successful , winning the Pulitzer Prize , and has become a classic of modern American literature . The plot and characters are loosely based on Lee 's observations of her family , her neighbors and an event that occurred near her hometown of Monroeville , Alabama , in 1936 , when she was 10 years old . The story is told by the six - year - old Jean Louise Finch . The novel is renowned for its warmth and humor , despite dealing with the serious issues of rape and racial inequality . The narrator 's father , Atticus Finch , has served as a moral hero for many readers and as a model of integrity for lawyers . One critic explains the novel 's impact by writing , `` In the twentieth century , To Kill a Mockingbird is probably the most widely read book dealing with race in America , and its protagonist , Atticus Finch , the most enduring fictional image of racial heroism . '' As a Southern Gothic novel and a Bildungsroman , the primary themes of To Kill a Mockingbird involve racial injustice and the destruction of innocence . Scholars have noted that Lee also addresses issues of class , courage , compassion , and gender roles in the American Deep South . The book is widely taught in schools in the United States with lessons that emphasize tolerance and decry prejudice . Despite its themes , To Kill a Mockingbird has been subject to campaigns for removal from public classrooms , often challenged for its use of racial epithets . Reaction to the novel varied widely upon publication . Despite the number of copies sold and its widespread use in education , literary analysis of it is sparse . Author Mary McDonough Murphy , who collected individual impressions of To Kill a Mockingbird by several authors and public figures , calls the book `` an astonishing phenomenon '' . In 2006 , British librarians ranked the book ahead of the Bible as one `` every adult should read before they die '' . It was adapted into an Academy Award - winning film in 1962 by director Robert Mulligan , with a screenplay by Horton Foote . Since 1990 , a play based on the novel has been performed annually in Harper Lee 's hometown . To Kill a Mockingbird was Lee 's only published book until Go Set a Watchman , an earlier draft of To Kill a Mockingbird , was published on July 14 , 2015 . Lee continued to respond to her work 's impact until her death in February 2016 , although she had refused any personal publicity for herself or the novel since 1964 .

She attended Huntingdon College in Montgomery ( 1944 -- 45 ) , and then studied law at the University of Alabama ( 1945 -- 49 ) . While attending college , she wrote for campus literary magazines : Huntress at Huntingdon and the humor magazine Rammer Jammer at the University of Alabama . At both colleges , she wrote short stories and other works about racial injustice , a rarely mentioned topic on such campuses at the time . In 1950 , Lee moved to New York City , where she worked as a reservation clerk for British Overseas Airways Corporation ; there , she began writing a collection of essays and short stories about people in Monroeville . Hoping to be published , Lee presented her writing in 1957 to a literary agent recommended by Capote .",

External video Interview with Mary McDonagh Murphy on Scout , Atticus & Boo , June 26 , 2010 , C - SPAN Many writers compare their perceptions of To Kill a Mockingbird as adults with when they first read it as children . Mary McDonagh Murphy interviewed celebrities including Oprah Winfrey , Rosanne Cash , Tom Brokaw , and Harper 's sister Alice Lee , who read the novel and compiled their impressions of it as children and adults into a book titled Scout , Atticus , and Boo . Atticus Finch and the legal profession Main article : Atticus Finch I promised myself that when I grew up and I was a man , I would try to do things just as good and noble as what Atticus had done for Tom Robinson . -- Scott Turow One of the most significant impacts To Kill a Mockingbird has had is Atticus Finch 's model of integrity for the legal profession . As scholar Alice Petry explains , `` Atticus has become something of a folk hero in legal circles and is treated almost as if he were an actual person . '' Morris Dees of the Southern Poverty Law Center cites Atticus Finch as the reason he became a lawyer , and Richard Matsch , the federal judge who presided over the Timothy McVeigh trial , counts Atticus as a major judicial influence . One law professor at the University of Notre Dame stated that the most influential textbook he taught from was To Kill a Mockingbird , and an article in the Michigan Law Review claims , `` No real - life lawyer has done more for the self - image or public perception of the legal profession , '' before questioning whether `` Atticus Finch is a paragon of honor or an especially slick hired gun '' . In 1992 , an Alabama editorial called for the death of Atticus , saying that as liberal as Atticus was , he still worked within a system of institutionalized racism and sexism and should not be revered . The editorial sparked a flurry of responses from attorneys who entered the profession because of him and esteemed him as a hero . Critics of Atticus maintain he is morally ambiguous and does not use his legal skills to challenge the racist status quo in Maycomb . However , in 1997 , the Alabama State Bar erected a monument to Atticus in Monroeville , marking his existence as the `` first commemorative milestone in the state 's judicial history '' . In 2008 , Lee herself received an honorary special membership to the Alabama State Bar for creating Atticus who `` has become the personification of the exemplary lawyer in serving the legal needs of the poor '' . Social commentary and challenges To Kill a Mockingbird has been a source of significant controversy since its being the subject of classroom study as early as 1963 . The book 's racial slurs , profanity , and frank discussion of rape have led people to challenge its appropriateness in libraries and classrooms across the United States . The American Library Association reported that To Kill a Mockingbird was number 21 of the 100 most frequently challenged books of 2000 -- 2009 . Following parental complaints about the racist language it contains , the novel was removed from classrooms in Virginia in 2016 and Biloxi in 2017 , where it was described as making people `` uncomfortable . '' In the Mississippi case , the novel was removed from the required reading list but subsequently made available to interested students with parental consent . Such decisions have been criticised : the American Civil Liberties Union noted the importance of engaging with the novel 's themes in places where racial injustice persists .",

Jane Fonda also criticized The Deer Hunter in public . Deeley suggested that her criticisms partly stemmed from the competition between her film Coming Home vying with The Deer Hunter for Best Picture . According to Deeley , he planted a friend of his in the Oscar press area behind the stage to ask Fonda if she had seen The Deer Hunter . Fonda replied she had not seen the film , and to this day she still has not . As the Oscars drew near , the backlash against The Deer Hunter gathered strength . When the limos pulled up to the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion on April 9 , 1979 , they were met by demonstrators , mostly from the Los Angeles chapter of Vietnam Veterans Against the War . The demonstrators waved placards covered with slogans that read `` No Oscars for racism '' and `` The Deer Hunter a bloody lie '' and thrust pamphlets berating Deer Hunter into long lines of limousine windows . Washburn , nominated for Best Original Screenplay , claims his limousine was pelted with stones . According to Variety , `` Police and The Deer Hunter protesters clashed in a brief but bloody battle that resulted in 13 arrests . '' De Niro was so anxious that he did not attend the Oscars ceremony . He asked the Academy to sit out the show backstage , but when the Academy refused , De Niro stayed home in New York .

While the film opened the same year as Hal Ashby 's Coming Home , Sidney Furie 's The Boys in Company C , and Ted Post 's Go Tell the Spartans , it was the first film about Vietnam to reach a wide audience and critical acclaim , culminating in the winning of the Oscar for Best Picture . Other films released in later decades that illustrated the ' hellish ' , futile conditions of bloody Vietnam War combat included : Francis Ford Coppola 's Apocalypse Now ( 1979 ) Oliver Stone 's Platoon ( 1986 ) Stanley Kubrick 's Full Metal Jacket ( 1987 ) John Irvin 's Hamburger Hill ( 1987 ) Oliver Stone 's Born on the Fourth of July ( 1989 ) David Thomson wrote in an article titled `` The Deer Hunter : Story of a scene '' that the film changed the way war - time battles were portrayed on film : `` The terror and the blast of firepower changed the war film , even if it only used a revolver .",

'' Andrew Sarris wrote in his review of Heaven 's Gate , `` I 'm a little surprised that many of the same critics who lionized Cimino for The Deer Hunter have now thrown him to the wolves with equal enthusiasm .

Hence , the stupidity and incoherence in Heaven 's Gate came as no surprise since very much the same stupidity and incoherence had been amply evident in The Deer Hunter .

' '' More recently , British film critic Mark Kermode challenged the film 's status : `` At the risk of being thrown out of the ' respectable film critics ' circle , may I take this opportunity to declare officially that in my opinion The Deer Hunter is one of the worst films ever made , a rambling self indulgent , self aggrandizing barf-fest steeped in manipulatively racist emotion , and notable primarily for its farcically melodramatic tone which is pitched somewhere between shrieking hysteria and somnambulist sombreness . '' However , many critics , including David Thomson and A.O. Scott. , maintain that The Deer Hunter is still a great film , the power of which has n't since diminished .

Best Editing , Peter Zinner Lead - up to Awards season ( edit ) Film producer and `` old - fashioned mogul '' Allan Carr used his networking abilities to promote The Deer Hunter . `` Exactly how Allan Carr came into The Deer Hunter 's orbit I can no longer remember , '' recalled producer Deeley , `` but the picture became a crusade to him . He nagged , charmed , threw parties , he created word - of - mouth -- everything that could be done in Hollywood to promote a project . Because he had no apparent motive for this promotion , it had an added power and legitimacy and it finally did start to penetrate the minds of the Universal 's sales people that they actually had in their hands something a bit more significant than the usual . '' Deeley added that Carr 's promotion of the film was influential in positioning The Deer Hunter for Oscar nominations . On the Sneak Previews special `` Oscar Preview for 1978 '' , Roger Ebert correctly predicted that The Deer Hunter would win for Best Picture while Gene Siskel predicted that Coming Home would win . However , Ebert incorrectly guessed that Robert De Niro would win for Best Actor for Deer Hunter and Jill Clayburgh would win for Best Actress for An Unmarried Woman while Siskel called the wins for Jon Voight as Best Actor and Jane Fonda as Best Actress , both for Coming Home . Both Ebert and Siskel called the win for Christopher Walken receiving the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor . According to producer Deeley , orchestrated lobbying against The Deer Hunter was led by Warren Beatty , whose own picture Heaven Can Wait had multiple nominations . Beatty also used ex-girlfriends in his campaign : Julie Christie , serving on the jury at the Berlin Film Festival where Deer Hunter was screened , joined the walkout of the film by the Russian jury members . Jane Fonda also criticized The Deer Hunter in public . Deeley suggested that her criticisms partly stemmed from the competition between her film Coming Home vying with The Deer Hunter for Best Picture . According to Deeley , he planted a friend of his in the Oscar press area behind the stage to ask Fonda if she had seen The Deer Hunter . Fonda replied she had not seen the film , and to this day she still has not .",

Broadcast from 1998 until 2004 , the original run of the show had a total of 94 episodes . Throughout its six - year run , the show received contributions from various producers , writers , and directors , perhaps most significantly from Michael Patrick King . Set and filmed in New York City and based on the 1997 book of the same name by Candace Bushnell , the show follows the lives of a group of four women -- three in their mid-thirties and one in her forties -- who , despite their different natures and ever - changing sex lives , remain inseparable and confide in each other . Starring Sarah Jessica Parker ( as Carrie Bradshaw ) , Kim Cattrall ( as Samantha Jones ) , Kristin Davis ( as Charlotte York ) , and Cynthia Nixon ( as Miranda Hobbes ) , the quirky series had multiple continuing storylines that tackled relevant and modern social issues such as sexuality , safe sex , promiscuity , and femininity , while exploring the difference between friendships and romantic relationships . The deliberate omission of the better part of the early lives of the four women was the writers ' way of exploring social life -- from sex to relationships -- through each of their four very different , individual perspectives . The series received both acclaim and criticism for its subjects and characters , and is credited with helping jump - start HBO . It spawned two feature films , Sex and the City ( 2008 ) and its sequel Sex and the City 2 ( 2010 ) , and a prequel series by The CW , The Carrie Diaries . It also won seven of its 54 Emmy Award nominations , eight of its 24 Golden Globe Award nominations , and three of its 11 Screen Actors Guild Award nominations . Sex in the City still airs in syndication worldwide and has been listed on Entertainment Weekly s end - of - the - decade `` best of '' list and as one of Time magazine 's 100 Best TV Shows of All - TIME . The show placed # 5 on Entertainment Weekly 's `` New TV Classics '' list . In 2013 , TV Guide ranked it at # 40 on its list of the Best Series of All Time .

Bushnell has said in several interviews that the Carrie Bradshaw in her columns is her alter ego ; when she wrote the `` Sex and the City '' essays , she used her own name initially , but for privacy reasons , later created the character played in the series by Sarah Jessica Parker . Carrie Bradshaw was a writer living in New York City . Carrie Bradshaw and Candace Bushnell have the same initials , a flourish emphasizing their connection . Moreover , just as Carrie Bradshaw eventually gets her articles for the fictional ' New York Star ' published as a book in later series , the entire Sex and the City series is based on a compilation of Bushnell 's own columns for the ' New York Observer .

The battles were fought on April 19 , 1775 in Middlesex County , Province of Massachusetts Bay , within the towns of Lexington , Concord , Lincoln , Menotomy ( present - day Arlington ) , and Cambridge . They marked the outbreak of armed conflict between the Kingdom of Great Britain and its thirteen colonies in America . In late 1774 , Colonial leaders adopted the Suffolk Resolves in resistance to the alterations made to the Massachusetts colonial government by the British parliament following the Boston Tea Party . The colonial assembly responded by forming a Patriot provisional government known as the Massachusetts Provincial Congress and calling for local militias to train for possible hostilities . The Colonial government exercised effective control of the colony outside of British - controlled Boston . In response , the British government in February 1775 declared Massachusetts to be in a state of rebellion . About 700 British Army regulars in Boston , under Lieutenant Colonel Francis Smith , were given secret orders to capture and destroy Colonial military supplies reportedly stored by the Massachusetts militia at Concord . Through effective intelligence gathering , Patriot leaders had received word weeks before the expedition that their supplies might be at risk and had moved most of them to other locations . On the night before the battle , warning of the British expedition had been rapidly sent from Boston to militias in the area by several riders , including Paul Revere , with information about British plans . The initial mode of the Army 's arrival by water was signaled from the Old North Church in Boston to Charleston using lanterns to communicate `` one if by land , two if by sea '' . The first shots were fired just as the sun was rising at Lexington . Eight militiamen were killed , including Ensign Robert Munroe , their ranking officer . The British suffered only one casualty . The militia were outnumbered and fell back , and the regulars proceeded on to Concord , where they broke apart into companies to search for the supplies . At the North Bridge in Concord , approximately 400 militiamen engaged 100 regulars from three companies of the King 's troops at about 11 : 00 am , resulting in casualties on both sides . The outnumbered regulars fell back from the bridge and rejoined the main body of British forces in Concord . The British forces began their return march to Boston after completing their search for military supplies , and more militiamen continued to arrive from neighboring towns . Gunfire erupted again between the two sides and continued throughout the day as the regulars marched back towards Boston .",

Major Pitcairn commanded ten elite light infantry companies , and Lieutenant Colonel Benjamin Bernard commanded 11 grenadier companies , under the overall command of Lieutenant Colonel Smith . Of the troops assigned to the expedition , 350 were from grenadier companies drawn from the 4th ( King 's Own ) , 5th , 10th , 18th ( Royal Irish ) , 23rd , 38th , 43rd , 47th , 52nd and 59th Regiments of Foot , and the 1st Battalion of His Majesty 's Marine Forces . Protecting the grenadier companies were about 320 light infantry from the 4th , 5th , 10th , 23rd , 38th , 43rd , 47th , 52nd , and 59th Regiments , and the 1st Battalion of the Marines . Each company had its own lieutenant , but the majority of the captains commanding them were volunteers attached to them at the last minute , drawn from all the regiments stationed in Boston . This lack of familiarity between commander and company would cause problems during the battle . The British began to awaken their troops at 9 pm on the night of April 18 and assembled them on the water 's edge on the western end of Boston Common by 10 pm . Colonel Smith was late in arriving , and there was no organized boat - loading operation , resulting in confusion at the staging area . The boats used were naval barges that were packed so tightly that there was no room to sit down . When they disembarked near Phipps Farm in Cambridge , it was into waist - deep water at midnight . After a lengthy halt to unload their gear , the regulars began their 17 miles ( 27 km ) march to Concord at about 2 am . During the wait they were provided with extra ammunition , cold salt pork , and hard sea biscuits . They did not carry knapsacks , since they would not be encamped . They carried their haversacks ( food bags ) , canteens , muskets , and accoutrements , and marched off in wet , muddy shoes and soggy uniforms . As they marched through Menotomy , sounds of the colonial alarms throughout the countryside caused the few officers who were aware of their mission to realize they had lost the element of surprise . At about 3 am , Colonel Smith sent Major Pitcairn ahead with six companies of light infantry under orders to quick march to Concord . At about 4 am Smith made the wise but belated decision to send a messenger back to Boston asking for reinforcements . The Battles Lexington BEP engraved vignette Battle of Lexington which appeared on the $20 National Bank Note Battle of Lexington , April 19 , 1775 , New York Public Library Though often styled a battle , in reality the engagement at Lexington was a minor brush or skirmish . As the regulars ' advance guard under Pitcairn entered Lexington at sunrise on April 19 , 1775 , about 80 Lexington militiamen emerged from Buckman Tavern and stood in ranks on the village common watching them , and between 40 and 100 spectators watched from along the side of the road . Their leader was Captain John Parker , a veteran of the French and Indian War , who was suffering from tuberculosis and was at times difficult to hear . Of the militiamen who lined up , nine had the surname Harrington , seven Munroe ( including the company 's orderly sergeant , William Munroe ) , four Parker , three Tidd , three Locke , and three Reed ; fully one quarter of them were related to Captain Parker in some way . This group of militiamen was part of Lexington 's `` training band '' , a way of organizing local militias dating back to the Puritans , and not what was styled a minuteman company . After having waited most of the night with no sign of any British troops ( and wondering if Paul Revere 's warning was true ) , at about 4 : 15 a.m. , Parker got his confirmation . Thaddeus Bowman , the last scout that Parker had sent out , rode up at a gallop and told him that they were not only coming , but coming in force and they were close . Captain Parker was clearly aware that he was outmatched in the confrontation and was not prepared to sacrifice his men for no purpose .",

It eventually became the city of Lexington , Kentucky . Legacy Gravemarkers along Battle Road in Lexington are maintained with Britain 's 1775 version of the Union Flag . It was important to the early American government that an image of British fault and American innocence be maintained for this first battle of the war . The history of Patriot preparations , intelligence , warning signals , and uncertainty about the first shot was rarely discussed in the public sphere for decades . The story of the wounded British soldier at the North Bridge , hors de combat , struck down on the head by a Minuteman using a hatchet , the purported `` scalping '' , was strongly suppressed . Depositions mentioning some of these activities were not published and were returned to the participants ( this notably happened to Paul Revere ) . Paintings portrayed the Lexington fight as an unjustified slaughter . The issue of which side was to blame grew during the early nineteenth century . For example , older participants ' testimony in later life about Lexington and Concord differed greatly from their depositions taken under oath in 1775 . All now said the British fired first at Lexington , whereas fifty or so years before , they were n't sure . All now said they fired back , but in 1775 , they said few were able to . The `` Battle '' took on an almost mythical quality in the American consciousness . Legend became more important than truth . A complete shift occurred , and the Patriots were portrayed as actively fighting for their cause , rather than as suffering innocents . Paintings of the Lexington skirmish began to portray the militia standing and fighting back in defiance . Ralph Waldo Emerson immortalized the events at the North Bridge in his 1837 `` Concord Hymn '' . The `` Concord Hymn '' became important because it commemorated the beginning of the American Revolution , and that for much of the 19th century it was a means by which Americans learned about the Revolution , helping to forge the identity of the nation . After 1860 , several generations of schoolchildren memorized Henry Wadsworth Longfellow 's poem `` Paul Revere 's Ride '' . Historically it is inaccurate ( for example , Paul Revere never made it to Concord ) , but it captures the idea that an individual can change the course of history . By the rude bridge that arched the flood Their flag to April 's breeze unfurled Here once the embattled farmers stood And fired the shot heard round the world . -- First verse of Emerson 's `` Concord Hymn '' In the 20th century , popular and historical opinion varied about the events of the historic day , often reflecting the political mood of the time . Isolationist anti-war sentiments before the World Wars bred skepticism about the nature of Paul Revere 's contribution ( if any ) to the efforts to rouse the militia . Anglophilia in the United States after the turn of the twentieth century led to more balanced approaches to the history of the battle . During World War I , a film about Paul Revere 's ride was seized under the Espionage Act of 1917 for promoting discord between the United States and Britain . During the Cold War , Revere was used not only as a patriotic symbol , but also as a capitalist one . In 1961 , novelist Howard Fast published April Morning , an account of the battle from a fictional 15 - year - old 's perspective , and reading of the book has been frequently assigned in American secondary schools . A film version was produced for television in 1987 , starring Chad Lowe and Tommy Lee Jones . In the 1990s , parallels were drawn between American tactics in the Vietnam War and those of the British Army at Lexington and Concord . The site of the battle in Lexington is now known as the Lexington Battle Green , has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places , and is a National Historic Landmark . Several memorials commemorating the battle have been established there .",

It may take forms including art ware , tile , figurines , sculpture , and tableware . Ceramic art is one of the arts , particularly the visual arts . Of these , it is one of the plastic arts . While some ceramics are considered fine art , as pottery or sculpture , some are considered to be decorative , industrial or applied art objects . Ceramics may also be considered artefacts in archaeology . Ceramic art can be made by one person or by a group of people . In a pottery or ceramic factory , a group of people design , manufacture and decorate the art ware . Products from a pottery are sometimes referred to as `` art pottery '' . In a one - person pottery studio , ceramists or potters produce studio pottery . The word `` ceramics '' comes from the Greek keramikos ( \u03ba\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 ) , meaning `` pottery '' , which in turn comes from keramos ( \u03ba\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 ) meaning `` potter 's clay '' . Most traditional ceramic products were made from clay ( or clay mixed with other materials ) , shaped and subjected to heat , and tableware and decorative ceramics are generally still made this way . In modern ceramic engineering usage , ceramics is the art and science of making objects from inorganic , non-metallic materials by the action of heat . It excludes glass and mosaic made from glass tesserae . There is a long history of ceramic art in almost all developed cultures , and often ceramic objects are all the artistic evidence left from vanished cultures , like that of the Nok in Africa over 2,000 years ago . Cultures especially noted for ceramics include the Chinese , Cretan , Greek , Persian , Mayan , Japanese , and Korean cultures , as well as the modern Western cultures . Elements of ceramic art , upon which different degrees of emphasis have been placed at different times , are the shape of the object , its decoration by painting , carving and other methods , and the glazing found on most ceramics .

The body of the object may be hard - paste porcelain , developed in China in the 7th or 8th century , or soft - paste porcelain ( often bone china ) , developed in 18th - century Europe . The broader term ceramic painting includes painted decoration on lead - glazed earthenware such as creamware or tin - glazed pottery such as maiolica or faience . Typically the body is first fired in a kiln to convert it into a hard porous bisque . Underglaze decoration may then be applied , followed by glaze , which is fired so it bonds to the body . The glazed porcelain may then be decorated with overglaze painting and fired again to bond the paint with the glaze . Decorations may be applied by brush or by stenciling , transfer printing , lithography and screen printing . Slipware ( edit ) Main article : Slipware Slipware is a type of pottery identified by its primary decorating process where slip is placed onto the leather - hard clay body surface before firing by dipping , painting or splashing . Slip is an aqueous suspension of a clay body , which is a mixture of clays and other minerals such as quartz , feldspar and mica . A coating of white or coloured slip , known as an engobe , can be applied to the article to improve its appearance , to give a smoother surface to a rough body , mask an inferior colour or for decorative effect . Slips or engobes can also be applied by painting techniques , in isolation or in several layers and colours . Sgraffito involves scratching through a layer of coloured slip to reveal a different colour or the base body underneath . Several layers of slip and / or sgraffito can be done while the pot is still in an unfired state . One colour of slip can be fired , before a second is applied , and prior to the scratching or incising decoration . This is particularly useful if the base body is not of the desired colour or texture . Terra sigillata ( edit ) Main article : Terra sigillata In sharp contrast to the archaeological usage , in which the term terra sigillata refers to a whole class of pottery , in contemporary ceramic art , ' terra sigillata ' describes only a watery refined slip used to facilitate the burnishing of raw clay surfaces and used to promote carbon smoke effects , in both primitive low temperature firing techniques and unglazed alternative western - style Raku firing techniques . Terra sigillata is also used as a brushable decorative colourant medium in higher temperature glazed ceramic techniques . Forms ( edit ) Studio pottery ( edit ) Main article : Studio pottery Studio pottery is pottery made by amateur or professional artists or artisans working alone or in small groups , making unique items or short runs . Typically , all stages of manufacture are carried out by the artists themselves . Studio pottery includes functional wares such as tableware , cookware and non-functional wares such as sculpture . Studio potters can be referred to as ceramic artists , ceramists , ceramicists or as an artist who uses clay as a medium . Much studio pottery is tableware or cookware but an increasing number of studio potters produce non-functional or sculptural items . Some studio potters now prefer to call themselves ceramic artists , ceramists or simply artists . Studio pottery is represented by potters all over the world . Tile ( edit ) Main article : Tile Upper part of the mihrab decorated with lusterware tiles ( dating from the 9th century ) in the Mosque of Uqba also known as the Great Mosque of Kairouan , Tunisia Tile , Hopi Pueblo ( Native American ) , late 19th -- early 20th century A tile is a manufactured piece of hard - wearing material such as ceramic , stone , metal , or even glass , generally used for covering roofs , floors , walls , showers , or other objects such as tabletops . Alternatively , tile can sometimes refer to similar units made from lightweight materials such as perlite , wood , and mineral wool , typically used for wall and ceiling applications . In another sense , a `` tile '' is a construction tile or similar object , such as rectangular counters used in playing games ( see tile - based game ) . The word is derived from the French word tuile , which is , in turn , from the Latin word tegula , meaning a roof tile composed of fired clay .",

Many types of pottery have been made from it from the earliest times , and until the 18th century it was the most common type of pottery outside the far East . Earthenware is often made from clay , quartz and feldspar . Terracotta , a type of earthenware , is a clay - based unglazed or glazed ceramic , where the fired body is porous . Its uses include vessels ( notably flower pots ) , water and waste water pipes , bricks , and surface embellishment in building construction . Terracotta has been a common medium for ceramic art ( see below ) . Stoneware is a vitreous or semi-vitreous ceramic made primarily from stoneware clay or non-refractory fire clay . Stoneware is fired at high temperatures . Vitrified or not , it is nonporous ; it may or may not be glazed . One widely recognised definition is from the Combined Nomenclature of the European Communities , a European industry standard states `` Stoneware , which , though dense , impermeable and hard enough to resist scratching by a steel point , differs from porcelain because it is more opaque , and normally only partially vitrified . It may be vitreous or semi-vitreous . It is usually coloured grey or brownish because of impurities in the clay used for its manufacture , and is normally glazed . '' Porcelain is a ceramic material made by heating materials , generally including kaolin , in a kiln to temperatures between 1,200 and 1,400 \u00b0 C ( 2,200 and 2,600 \u00b0 F ) . The toughness , strength and translucence of porcelain , relative to other types of pottery , arises mainly from vitrification and the formation of the mineral mullite within the body at these high temperatures . Properties associated with porcelain include low permeability and elasticity ; considerable strength , hardness , toughness , whiteness , translucency and resonance ; and a high resistance to chemical attack and thermal shock . Porcelain has been described as being `` completely vitrified , hard , impermeable ( even before glazing ) , white or artificially coloured , translucent ( except when of considerable thickness ) , and resonant '' . However , the term porcelain lacks a universal definition and has `` been applied in a very unsystematic fashion to substances of diverse kinds which have only certain surface - qualities in common '' . Bone china ( fine china ) is a type of soft - paste porcelain that is composed of bone ash , feldspathic material , and kaolin . It has been defined as ware with a translucent body containing a minimum of 30 % of phosphate derived from animal bone and calculated calcium phosphate . Developed by English potter Josiah Spode , bone china is known for its high levels of whiteness and translucency , and very high mechanical strength and chip resistance . Its high strength allows it to be produced in thinner cross-sections than other types of porcelain . Like stoneware it is vitrified , but is translucent due to differing mineral properties . From its initial development and up to the later part of the twentieth century , bone china was almost exclusively an English product , with production being effectively localised in Stoke - on - Trent . Most major English firms made or still make it , including Mintons , Coalport , Spode , Royal Crown Derby , Royal Doulton , Wedgwood and Worcester . In the UK , references to `` china '' or `` porcelain '' can refer to bone china , and `` English porcelain '' has been used as a term for it , both in the UK and around the world .

A Winston sponsored smoking room at Dubai International Airport . United Arab Emirates ( edit ) In the United Arab Emirates , tobacco advertisements are forbidden under federal anti-tobacco law No 15 of 2009 , effective from January 21 , 2014 . Europe ( edit ) All tobacco advertising and sponsorship on television has been banned within the European Union since 1991 under the Television Without Frontiers Directive ( 1989 ) . This ban was extended by the Tobacco Advertising Directive , which took effect in July 2005 to cover other forms of media such as the internet , print media , radio , and sports events like F1 . The directive does not include advertising in cinemas and on billboards or using merchandising -- or tobacco sponsorship of cultural and sporting events which are purely local , with participants coming from only one member state as these fall outside the jurisdiction of the European Commission . However , most member states have transposed the directive with national laws that are wider in scope than the directive and cover local advertising . A 2008 European Commission report concluded that the directive had been successfully transposed into national law in all EU member states , and that these laws were well implemented . In 2003 , the European Union halted the branding of cigarettes as `` light '' or `` mild '' , saying that this misleads consumers about the dangers of smoking . Stark health warnings such as `` Smoking Kills '' must now cover at least 30 % of the front of each packet and 40 % of the back , and an even greater area where messages are printed in more than one national language . Within the European Union only Germany and Bulgaria still permit billboards advertising tobacco use . Tobacco smoking is still advertised in special magazines , during sporting events , in filling stations and shops , and in more rare cases on television . Some nations , including the UK and Australia , have begun anti-smoking advertisements to counter the effects of tobacco advertising . In Ukraine , tobacco advertising `` in all printed mass media '' has been illegal since 1 January 2010 . Some countries , like Finland and Greece , had outlawed tobacco advertising on television and radio prior to the ban in 1991 . France ( edit ) As a result of the enactment of the 2016 plain tobacco packaging bill , France became the second country in the world in January 2017 , after Australia , to require tobacco products to be sold in plain packaging . Ireland ( edit ) Tobacco advertising on radio , television and billboards is illegal . In July 2009 , in - store tobacco advertising and displays of tobacco were made illegal -- Ireland being the first country in the EU ( and third in the world , after Canada and Iceland ) to do so . Ireland plans to adopt the Australian model of plain - packaged cigarettes which is due to begin in September 2017 . United Kingdom ( edit ) The relevant EU directives banning tobacco advertising apply within the United Kingdom , in addition to UK laws restricting tobacco advertising . Surreal Benson & Hedges poster at Victoria Station , London , c. 1978 The first calls to restrict advertising came in 1962 from the Royal College of Physicians , who highlighted the health problems and recommended stricter laws on the sale and advertising of tobacco products . In 1971 , an agreement between the government and the tobacco industry saw the inclusion of health warnings on all cigarette packets . All television commercials for cigarettes were banned on 1 August 1965 , although commercials for loose tobacco and cigars continued until 1991 . Non-television advertising campaigns were still allowed in the UK but came under stricter guidelines in 1986 , which in particular , prevented adverts from actually showing a person smoking . The tobacco producers responded with increasingly indirect and abstract campaigns , among which those of Benson & Hedges and Silk Cut became particularly recognisable . Until about the mid-1990s , many corner shops , newsagents and off licences had on their shop signs prominent branding by cigarette brands such as Benson & Hedges , Silk Cut , Regal etc. until the practice was outlawed .

As part of their 1997 general election campaign , the Labour Party led by Tony Blair pledged to ban all advertising of tobacco products . When it was not included in their manifesto , it was introduced by Liberal Democrat Peer Tim Clement - Jones and was passed as the Tobacco Advertising and Promotion Act 2002 , which banned most remaining forms of advertising according to the following timescale : Date What was banned 14 February 2003 General advertising 14 May 2003 Promotions 30 July 2003 Sponsorship of sporting events within the UK May 2004 Particular advertisements in tobacconists 21 December 2004 Large adverts in shops , pubs and clubs 31 July 2005 Sponsorship of excepted global events ; brandsharing It was banned in Scotland by the Scottish Executive in 2001 . Several exemptions from this legislation remain : Advertisements that appear within the tobacco industry Advertisements in publications that are not primarily aimed at a British audience Advertisements in pubs , clubs and shops , as long as the advert 's total size does not exceed that of an A5 piece of paper , with 30 % of that being taken up by government health warnings . Advertisements other than those for cigarettes or hand - rolling tobacco within specialist tobacconists if the sale of cigars , snuff , pipe tobacco and smoking accessories accounts for over 50 % of their sales Direct mail that has been specifically requested While cigarette vending machines were still allowed in licensed premises ( until 1 October 2011 in England , 1 February 2012 in Wales , 1 March 2012 in Northern Ireland and 29 April 2013 in Scotland when a full ban came into force ) they were only allowed to display a picture of what was available ( one image per brand ) and no advertisements could be included on the machine . Finally , cigarette vending machines were then banned in public areas of all British pubs , clubs and restaurants , with a fine of \u00a3 2,500 for non-compliance . Famous UK tobacco advertising campaigns have included `` You 're never alone with a Strand '' ( a disastrous campaign which led to Strand Cigarettes being taken off the market ) and `` Happiness is a cigar called Hamlet '' . Italy ( edit ) In Italy , advertising of tobacco products has been banned since 1962 , though ad in magazines remained legal since the late - 1970s ; with a few subsequent changes to the law in 1983 and 2004 . The netherlands ( edit ) Tobacco advertising is only allowed in and around special tobacco stores , selling more than 90 kinds of tobacco products . Outside , no more than two square metres of advertisements is allowed . Inside the tobacco store , a limited amount of advertising is allowed . Salesmen can promote brands inside these stores , however their promotional material only contains dummy - cigarettes . Any other kind of advertising is a serious offence under Dutch law . Serbia ( edit ) In Serbia , tobacco advertising on television , on billboards and in printed media is banned , but advertisements for cigarettes are found within shops and kiosks . North America ( edit ) United States ( edit ) In the United States , in the 1950s and 1960s , cigarette brands were frequently sponsors of television programs . One of the most famous television jingles of the era came from an advertisement for Winston cigarettes . The slogan `` Winston tastes good like a cigarette should ! '' proved to be catchy .

In June 1967 , the Federal Communications Commission ruled that programs broadcast on a television station that discussed smoking and health were insufficient to offset the effects of paid advertisements that were broadcast for five to ten minutes each day . `` We hold that the fairness doctrine is applicable to such advertisements , '' the Commission said . The FCC decision , upheld by the courts , essentially required television stations to air anti-smoking advertisements at no cost to the organizations providing such advertisements . In April 1970 , President Nixon signed into law the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act banning the advertising of cigarettes on television and radio starting on 2 January 1971 . The Virginia Slims brand was the last commercial shown , with `` a 60 - second revue from flapper to Female Lib '' , shown at 11 : 59 p.m. on 1 January during a break on The Tonight Show . Smokeless tobacco ads , on the other hand , remained on the air until a ban took effect on 28 August 1986 . Even further restrictions took effect under the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act . Effective 22 June 2010 , the new regulations prohibit tobacco companies from sponsoring sports , music , and other cultural events . Also , tobacco companies can no longer display their logos or advertise their products on T - shirts , hats , or other apparel . Eventually , the law is planned to require almost all tobacco advertisements to consist of black text on a white background , but the constitutionality of that requirement has come under scrutiny . After 1971 , most tobacco advertising was done in magazines , newspapers , and on billboards . Since the introduction of the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act , all packaging and advertisements must display a health warning from the Surgeon General . In November 2003 , tobacco companies and magazine publishers agreed to cease the placement of advertisements in school library editions of four magazines with a large group of young readers : Time , People , Sports Illustrated , and Newsweek . A 1994 report by the Surgeon General , `` Preventing Tobacco Use Among Young People , '' asserted : `` When young people no longer want to smoke the epidemic itself will die . '' A critical task of public health was counteracting the `` indoctrination '' of the young when they were most susceptible . Hence the report dismissed as `` misguided '' the debate as to whether cigarette promotion `` caused '' young people to smoke ; the conclusion was that `` Whether causal or not , ( promotion ) fosters the uptake of smoking , initiating for many a dismal and relentless chain of events '' Passed in 1997 , the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement bans outdoor , billboard , and public transportation advertising of cigarettes in 46 states . It also prohibits tobacco advertising that targets young people , the usage of cartoons ( such as the Marlboro Man or Joe Camel ) in particular . In the states which have not signed the agreement , billboards are a major venue of cigarette advertising ( 10 % of Michigan billboards advertised alcohol and tobacco , according to the Detroit Free Press ) . In 2010 , the Tobacco Control Act became active and placed new restrictions on tobacco marketing , including extensive constraints concerning the circulation of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to minors . Newly effective with this act , `` audio advertisements are not permitted to contain any music or sound effects , while video advertisements are limited to static black text on a white background . Any audio soundtrack accompanying a video advertisement is limited to words only , with no music or sound effects . '' Canada ( edit ) In Canada , the advertising of tobacco products was prohibited by the Tobacco Products Control Act as of 1988 and all tobacco products must show attributed warning signs on all packaging . Immediately following the passing of the legislation through parliament , RJR - MacDonald ( RJR - MacDonald Inc. v. Canada ( Attorney General ) ) filed suit against the Government of Canada through the Quebec Superior Court .",

Another popular slogan from the 1960s was `` Us Tareyton smokers would rather fight than switch ! , '' which was used to advertise Tareyton cigarette...",

          "full_text": "However , historian Harold C. Syrett argues that business supported neutrality . Other historians state that the pro-war element was animated not by profit but by disgust with what Germany actually did , especially in Belgium , and the threat it represented to American ideals . Belgium kept the public 's sympathy as the Germans executed civilians , and English nurse Edith Cavell . American engineer Herbert Hoover led a private relief effort that won wide support . Compounding the Belgium atrocities were new weapons that Americans found repugnant , like poison gas and the aerial bombardment of innocent civilians as Zeppelins dropped bombs on London . Even anti-war spokesmen did not claim that Germany was innocent , and pro-German scripts were poorly received . Randolph Bourne criticized the moralist philosophy claiming it was a justification by American intellectual and power elites , like President Wilson , for going to war unnecessarily . He argues that the push for war started with the Preparedness movement , fueled by big business . While big business would not push much further than Preparedness , benefitting the most from neutrality , the movement would eventually evolve into a war - cry , led by war - hawk intellectuals under the guise of moralism . Bourne believes elites knew full well what going to war would entail and the price in American lives it would cost . If American elites could portray the United States ' role in the war as noble , they could convince the generally isolationist American public war would be acceptable . Above all , American attitudes towards Germany focused on the U-boats ( submarines ) , which sank the Lusitania in 1915 and other passenger ships `` without warning '' . That appeared to Americans as an unacceptable challenge to America 's rights as a neutral country , and as an unforgivable affront to humanity . After repeated diplomatic protests , Germany agreed to stop . But in 1917 the Germany military leadership decided that `` military necessity '' dictated the unrestricted use of their submarines . The Kaiser 's advisors felt America was enormously powerful economically but too weak militarily to make a difference . Declaration of war ( edit ) Germany ( edit ) On April 2 , 1917 , Wilson asked a special joint session of Congress to declare war on the German Empire , stating , `` We have no selfish ends to serve '' . To make the conflict seem like a better idea , he painted the conflict idealistically , stating that the war would `` make the world safe for democracy '' and later that it would be a `` war to end war '' . The United States had a moral responsibility to enter the war , Wilson proclaimed . The future of the world was being determined on the battlefield , and American national interest demanded a voice . Wilson 's definition of the situation won wide acclaim , and , indeed , has shaped America 's role in world and military affairs ever since . Wilson believed that if the Central Powers won , the consequences would be bad for the United States . Germany would have dominated the continent and perhaps would gain control of the seas as well . Latin America could well have fallen under Berlin 's control . The dream of spreading democracy , liberalism , and independence would have been shattered . On the other hand , if the Allies had won without help , there was a danger they would carve up the world without regard to American commercial interests . They were already planning to use government subsidies , tariff walls , and controlled markets to counter the competition posed by American businessmen . The solution was a third route , a `` peace without victory '' , according to Wilson . On April 6 , 1917 , Congress declared war . In the Senate , the resolution passed 82 to 6 , with Senators Harry Lane , William J. Stone , James Vardaman , Asle Gronna , Robert M. La Follette , Sr. , and George W. Norris voting against it . In the House , the declaration passed 373 to 50 , with Claude Kitchin , a senior Democrat , notably opposing it . Another opponent was Jeannette Rankin , who alone voted against entry into both World War I and World War II . Nearly all of the opposition came from the West and the Midwest . Austria - Hungary ( edit ) The United States Senate , in a 74 to 0 vote , declared war on Austria - Hungary on December 7 , 1917 , citing Austria - Hungary 's severing of diplomatic relations with the United States , its use of unrestricted submarine warfare and its alliance with Germany . The declaration passed in the United States House of Representatives by a vote of 365 to 1 .

Apart from an Anglophile element urging early support for the British , American public opinion reflected that of the president : the sentiment for neutrality was particularly strong among Irish Americans , German Americans and Scandinavian Americans , as well as among church leaders and among women in general . On the other hand , even before World War I had broken out , American opinion had been more negative toward Germany than towards any other country in Europe . Over time , especially after reports of atrocities in Belgium in 1914 and following the sinking of the passenger liner RMS Lusitania in 1915 , the American people increasingly came to see Germany as the aggressor in Europe . As U.S. president , it was Wilson who made the key policy decisions over foreign affairs : while the country was at peace , the domestic economy ran on a laissez - faire basis , with American banks making huge loans to Britain and France -- funds that were in large part used to buy munitions , raw materials , and food from across the Atlantic . Until 1917 , Wilson made minimal preparations for a land war and kept the United States Army on a small peacetime footing , despite increasing demands for enhanced preparedness . He did however expand the United States Navy . In 1917 , with Russia experiencing political upheaval following widespread disillusionment there over the war , and with Britain and France low on credit , Germany appeared to have the upper hand in Europe , while Germany 's ally , the Ottoman Empire , clung stubbornly to its possessions in the Middle East . In the same year , Germany decided to resume unrestricted submarine warfare against any vessel approaching British waters ; this attempt to starve Britain into surrender was balanced against the knowledge that it would almost certainly bring the United States into the war . Germany also made a secret offer to help Mexico regain territories lost in the Mexican -- American War in an encoded telegram known as the Zimmermann Telegram , which was intercepted by British Intelligence . Publication of that communique outraged Americans just as German U-boats started sinking American merchant ships in the North Atlantic . Wilson then asked Congress for `` a war to end all wars '' that would `` make the world safe for democracy '' , and Congress voted to declare war on Germany on April 6 , 1917 . On December 7 , 1917 , the U.S. declared war on Austria - Hungary . U.S. troops began arriving on the Western Front in large numbers in 1918 .

The wider sea approaches to Britain and France , their distance from German harbours and the smaller size of the German surface fleet all made it harder for Germany to reciprocate . Instead , Germany used submarines to lie in wait for , and then sink , merchant ships heading for enemy ports . The United States insisted on maintaining the traditional rights of ships registered in neutral countries and protested strongly against American ships being intercepted or sunk : the British seized American ships for supposed violations , while the Germans sank them -- often without warning , in violation of international law that said sailors must be allowed an opportunity to reach their lifeboats .",

Development and production ( edit ) Aaron Martin was inspired to write Slasher after his work on the first season of the medical series Saving Hope , including his writing of two Hope episodes where , in his words , `` people got chopped up . '' Martin would write the first episode of Slasher as a spec script , with two intentions for doing so : To offer it to prospective studios , and to show a writing style that was different from his previous work ( e.g. Saving Hope , Degrassi : The Next Generation , Being Erica ) . Though the script did not receive immediate interest , Shaftesbury Films would discover and option it to prospective broadcasters . The script would land at Canadian premium network Super Channel , who , their interest piqued in part by Slasher 's fixed - end format , would order it as a series . The American network Chiller , which specializes in the horror / thriller genre , would join in production sometime after Super Channel ; Slasher would be Chiller 's first foray into original scripted series content . Production on Slasher 's 8 - episode first season was announced on July 28 , 2015 , with filming taking place between then and October 2015 . Three Northern Ontario municipalities -- the cities of Sudbury and Sault Ste . Marie and the town of Parry Sound -- would stand in for the show 's fictitious location , the town of Waterbury . A first trailer for the series would be released on November 26 , 2015 . Unlike most TV series that film their episodes in order , Slasher , under the direction of Craig David Wallace , was shot as if it were a `` super-sized '' movie : Scenes from multiple episodes were shot at the same time , with the availability of locations and cast being factored in . The out - of - order schedule allowed the actors to know of their characters ' fates , especially those who had to film their death scenes one day but return later to film earlier scenes as necessary . As an example of this , Martin cited Mark Ghanim\u00e9 's first day on set , when his character , Justin Faysal , was laid out in a casket for a scene early in Slasher 's third episode ( Justin 's death , which took place in Episode 2 , would be filmed later on ) . On May 1 , 2017 , Slasher began filming a second season in Orangeville , Ontario , Canada .

Martin aims to tell `` a modern - day monster story '' in Slasher , combining three of his favorite genres : The contemporary murder mystery ( a la Broadchurch ) , the works of Agatha Christie ( one of Martin 's favorite crime writers ) , and the classic slasher films he grew up with . In terms of the latter , Martin has specifically cited the influences of Halloween and It Follows in Slasher 's use of a mysterious singular embodiment that is responsible for a series of killings .",

Early years On June 27 , 1954 , the USSR 's Obninsk Nuclear Power Plant became the world 's first nuclear power plant to generate electricity for a power grid , and produced around 5 megawatts of electric power . Later in 1954 , Lewis Strauss , then chairman of the United States Atomic Energy Commission ( U.S. AEC , forerunner of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the United States Department of Energy ) spoke of electricity in the future being `` too cheap to meter '' . Strauss was very likely referring to hydrogen fusion -- which was secretly being developed as part of Project Sherwood at the time -- but Strauss 's statement was interpreted as a promise of very cheap energy from nuclear fission . The U.S. AEC itself had issued far more realistic testimony regarding nuclear fission to the U.S. Congress only months before , projecting that `` costs can be brought down ... ( to ) ... about the same as the cost of electricity from conventional sources ... '' In 1955 the United Nations ' `` First Geneva Conference '' , then the world 's largest gathering of scientists and engineers , met to explore the technology . In 1957 EURATOM was launched alongside the European Economic Community ( the latter is now the European Union ) . The same year also saw the launch of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) . Calder Hall , United Kingdom -- The world 's first commercial nuclear power station . First connected to the national power grid on 27 August 1956 and officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 17 October 1956 The Shippingport Atomic Power Station in Shippingport , Pennsylvania was the first commercial reactor in the United States and was opened in 1957 . The world 's first commercial nuclear power station , Calder Hall at Windscale , England , was opened in 1956 with an initial capacity of 50 MW ( later 200 MW ) . The first commercial nuclear generator to become operational in the United States was the Shippingport Reactor ( Pennsylvania , December 1957 ) . One of the first organizations to develop nuclear power was the U.S. Navy , for the purpose of propelling submarines and aircraft carriers . The first nuclear - powered submarine , USS Nautilus , was put to sea in December 1954 . As of 2016 , the U.S. Navy submarine fleet is made up entirely of nuclear - powered vessels , with 75 submarines in service . Two U.S. nuclear submarines , USS Scorpion and USS Thresher , have been lost at sea . The Russian Navy is currently ( 2016 ) estimated to have 61 nuclear submarines in service ; eight Soviet and Russian nuclear submarines have been lost at sea . This includes the Soviet submarine K - 19 reactor accident in 1961 which resulted in 8 deaths and more than 30 other people were over-exposed to radiation . The Soviet submarine K - 27 reactor accident in 1968 resulted in 9 fatalities and 83 other injuries . Moreover , Soviet submarine K - 429 sank twice , but was raised after each incident . Several serious nuclear and radiation accidents have involved nuclear submarine mishaps . The U.S. Army also had a nuclear power program , beginning in 1954 . The SM - 1 Nuclear Power Plant , at Fort Belvoir , Virginia , was the first power reactor in the U.S. to supply electrical energy to a commercial grid ( VEPCO ) , in April 1957 , before Shippingport . The SL - 1 was a U.S. Army experimental nuclear power reactor at the National Reactor Testing Station in eastern Idaho . It underwent a steam explosion and meltdown in January 1961 , which killed its three operators . In the Soviet Union at The Mayak Production Association facility there were a number of accidents , including an explosion , that released 50 -- 100 tonnes of high - level radioactive waste , contaminating a huge territory in the eastern Urals and causing numerous deaths and injuries . The Soviet regime kept this accident secret for about 30 years .

'' The same year , his doctoral student James Chadwick discovered the neutron , which was immediately recognized as a potential tool for nuclear experimentation because of its lack of an electric charge . Experimentation with bombardment of materials with neutrons led Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric and Ir\u00e8ne Joliot - Curie to discover induced radioactivity in 1934 , which allowed the creation of radium - like elements at much less the price of natural radium . Further work by Enrico Fermi in the 1930s focused on using slow neutrons to increase the effectiveness of induced radioactivity . Experiments bombarding uranium with neutrons led Fermi to believe he had created a new , transuranic element , which was dubbed hesperium . But in 1938 , German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann , along with Austrian physicist Lise Meitner and Meitner 's nephew , Otto Robert Frisch , conducted experiments with the products of neutron - bombarded uranium , as a means of further investigating Fermi 's claims . They determined that the relatively tiny neutron split the nucleus of the massive uranium atoms into two roughly equal pieces , contradicting Fermi . This was an extremely surprising result : all other forms of nuclear decay involved only small changes to the mass of the nucleus , whereas this process -- dubbed `` fission '' as a reference to biology -- involved a complete rupture of the nucleus . Numerous scientists , including Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd , who was one of the first , recognized that if fission reactions released additional neutrons , a self - sustaining nuclear chain reaction could result . Once this was experimentally confirmed and announced by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliot - Curie in 1939 , scientists in many countries ( including the United States , the United Kingdom , France , Germany , and the Soviet Union ) petitioned their governments for support of nuclear fission research , just on the cusp of World War II , for the development of a nuclear weapon . First nuclear reactor In the United States , where Fermi and Szil\u00e1rd had both emigrated , this led to the creation of the first man - made reactor , known as Chicago Pile - 1 , which achieved criticality on December 2 , 1942 . This work became part of the Manhattan Project , a massive secret US government military project to make enriched uranium by building large reactors to breed plutonium for use in the first nuclear weapons . The US tested atom bombs and eventually these weapons were used to attack the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki . The first light bulbs ever lit by electricity generated by nuclear power at EBR - 1 at Argonne National Laboratory - West , December 20 , 1951 . In 1945 , the first widely distributed account of nuclear energy , in the form of the pocketbook The Atomic Age , discussed the peaceful future uses of nuclear energy and depicted a future where fossil fuels would go unused . Nobel laurette Glenn Seaborg , who later chaired the Atomic Energy Commission , is quoted as saying `` there will be nuclear powered earth - to - moon shuttles , nuclear powered artificial hearts , plutonium heated swimming pools for SCUBA divers , and much more '' . The United Kingdom , Canada , and the USSR proceeded to research and develop nuclear industries over the course of the late 1940s and early 1950s . Electricity was generated for the first time by a nuclear reactor on December 20 , 1951 , at the EBR - I experimental station near Arco , Idaho , which initially produced about 100 kW . Work was also strongly researched in the US on nuclear marine propulsion , with a test reactor being developed by 1953 ( eventually , the USS Nautilus , the first nuclear - powered submarine , would launch in 1955 ) . In 1953 , US President Dwight Eisenhower gave his `` Atoms for Peace '' speech at the United Nations , emphasizing the need to develop `` peaceful '' uses of nuclear power quickly .

The event was eventually rated at 6 on the seven - level INES scale ( third in severity only to the disasters at Chernobyl and Fukushima ) . Development Washington Public Power Supply System Nuclear Power Plants 3 and 5 were never completed . Installed nuclear capacity initially rose relatively quickly , rising from less than 1 gigawatt ( GW ) in 1960 to 100 GW in the late 1970s , and 300 GW in the late 1980s . Since the late 1980s worldwide capacity has risen much more slowly , reaching 366 GW in 2005 . Between around 1970 and 1990 , more than 50 GW of capacity was under construction ( peaking at over 150 GW in the late 1970s and early 1980s ) -- in 2005 , around 25 GW of new capacity was planned . More than two - thirds of all nuclear plants ordered after January 1970 were eventually cancelled . A total of 63 nuclear units were canceled in the USA between 1975 and 1980 . During the 1970s and 1980s rising economic costs ( related to extended construction times largely due to regulatory changes and pressure - group litigation ) and falling fossil fuel prices made nuclear power plants then under construction less attractive . In the 1980s ( U.S. ) and 1990s ( Europe ) , flat load growth and electricity liberalization also made the addition of large new baseload capacity unattractive . The 1973 oil crisis had a significant effect on countries , such as France and Japan , which had relied more heavily on oil for electric generation ( 39 % and 73 % respectively ) to invest in nuclear power . Some local opposition to nuclear power emerged in the early 1960s , and in the late 1960s some members of the scientific community began to express their concerns . These concerns related to nuclear accidents , nuclear proliferation , high cost of nuclear power plants , nuclear terrorism and radioactive waste disposal . In the early 1970s , there were large protests about a proposed nuclear power plant in Wyhl , Germany . The project was cancelled in 1975 and anti-nuclear success at Wyhl inspired opposition to nuclear power in other parts of Europe and North America . By the mid-1970s anti-nuclear activism had moved beyond local protests and politics to gain a wider appeal and influence , and nuclear power became an issue of major public protest . Although it lacked a single co-ordinating organization , and did not have uniform goals , the movement 's efforts gained a great deal of attention . In some countries , the nuclear power conflict `` reached an intensity unprecedented in the history of technology controversies '' . 120,000 people attended an anti-nuclear protest in Bonn , Germany , on October 14 , 1979 , following the Three Mile Island accident . In France , between 1975 and 1977 , some 175,000 people protested against nuclear power in ten demonstrations . In West Germany , between February 1975 and April 1979 , some 280,000 people were involved in seven demonstrations at nuclear sites . Several site occupations were also attempted . In the aftermath of the Three Mile Island accident in 1979 , some 120,000 people attended a demonstration against nuclear power in Bonn . In May 1979 , an estimated 70,000 people , including then governor of California Jerry Brown , attended a march and rally against nuclear power in Washington , D.C. Anti-nuclear power groups emerged in every country that has had a nuclear power programme . Three Mile Island and Chernobyl The abandoned city of Pripyat with Chernobyl plant in the distance . Health and safety concerns , the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island , and the 1986 Chernobyl disaster played a part in stopping new plant construction in many countries , although the public policy organization , the Brookings Institution states that new nuclear units , at the time of publishing in 2006 , had not been built in the U.S.",

The Marine garrison 's defensive emplacements were left intact by the raid , which primarily targeted the aircraft . The garrison -- supplemented by civilian construction workers employed by Morrison - Knudsen Corp. -- repelled several Japanese landing attempts . An American journalist reported that after the initial Japanese amphibious assault was beaten back with heavy losses on December 11 , the American commander was asked by his superiors if he needed anything . Popular legend has it that Maj . James Devereux sent back the message , `` Send us more Japs ! '' -- a reply that became famous . After the war , when Maj . Devereux learned that he had been credited with sending that message , he pointed out that he had not been the commander on Wake Island and denied sending the message . `` As far as I know , it was n't sent at all . None of us was that much of a damn fool . We already had more Japs than we could handle . '' In reality , Commander Winfield S. Cunningham , USN was in charge of Wake Island , not Devereux . Cunningham ordered that coded messages be sent during operations , and a junior officer had added `` send us '' and `` more Japs '' to the beginning and end of a message to confuse Japanese code breakers . This was put together at Pearl Harbor and passed on as part of the message . The U.S. Navy attempted to provide support from Hawaii but had suffered great losses at Pearl Harbor . The relief fleet they managed to organize was delayed by bad weather . The isolated U.S. garrison was overwhelmed by a reinforced and greatly superior Japanese invasion force on December 23 . American casualties numbered 52 military personnel ( Navy and Marine ) and approximately 70 civilians killed . Japanese losses exceeded 700 dead , with some estimates ranging as high as 1,000 . Wake 's defenders sank two Japanese destroyers and one submarine and shot down 24 Japanese aircraft . The relief fleet , en route , on hearing of the island 's loss , turned back . In the aftermath of the battle , most of the captured civilians and military personnel were sent to POW camps in Asia , though some of the civilian laborers were enslaved by the Japanese and tasked with improving the island 's defenses .

The Japanese - occupied island ( called by them \u014ctorishima ( \u5927 \u9ce5\u5cf6 ) or Big Bird Island for its birdlike shape ) was bombed several times by American aircraft ; one of these raids was the first mission for future United States President George H.W. Bush . U.S. Civilian POWs Memorial After a successful American air raid on October 5 , 1943 , Sakaibara ordered the execution of all of the 98 captured Americans who remained on the island . They were taken to the northern end of the island , blindfolded and machine - gunned . One prisoner escaped , carving the message `` 98 US PW 5 - 10 - 43 '' on a large coral rock near where the victims had been hastily buried in a mass grave . This unknown American was soon recaptured and beheaded . Sakaibara and his subordinate , Lt. Cmdr . Tachibana , were later sentenced to death after conviction for this and other war crimes . Tachibana 's sentence was later commuted to life in prison . Sakaibara was executed on June 18 , 1947 , on Guam . The remains of the murdered civilians were exhumed and reburied at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in section G . On September 4 , 1945 , the Japanese garrison surrendered to a detachment of United States Marines under the command of Brig. Gen. Lawson H.M. Sanderson . Post-world War II military and commercial airfield ( edit ) The original Drifter 's Reef bar , built near the harbor area at Wake Island , opened its doors to aircrews , visitors and other `` drifters '' on November 8 , 1949 . With the end of hostilities with Japan and the increase in international air travel driven in part by wartime advances in aeronautics , Wake Island became a critical mid-Pacific base for the servicing and refueling of military and commercial aircraft . The United States Navy resumed control of the island , and in October 1945 400 Seabees from the 85th Naval Construction Battalion arrived at Wake to clear the island of the effects of the war and to build basic facilities for a Naval Air Base . The base was completed in March 1946 and on September 24 regular commercial passenger service was resumed by Pan American Airways ( Pan Am ) . The era of the flying boats was nearly over , so Pan Am switched to longer - range , faster and more profitable airplanes that could land on Wake 's new coral runway . Other airlines that established transpacific routes through Wake included British Overseas Airways Corporation ( BOAC ) , Philippine Airlines and Transocean Airlines . Due to the substantial increase in the number of commercial flights , on July 1 , 1947 , the Navy transferred administration , operations and maintenance of the facilities at Wake to the Civil Aeronautics Administration ( CAA ) . In 1949 the CAA upgraded the runway by paving over the coral surface and extending its length to 7,000 feet . Korean War ( edit ) President Harry S. Truman awards the Distinguished Service Medal , Fourth Oak Leaf Cluster , to Gen. Douglas MacArthur during the Wake Island Conference . In June 1950 the Korean War began with the United States leading United Nations forces against North Korea . In July the Korean Airlift was started and the Military Air Transport Service ( MATS ) used the airfield and facilities at Wake as a key mid-Pacific refueling stop for its mission of transporting men and supplies to the Korean front . By September 120 military aircraft were landing at Wake per day . On October 15 U.S. President Harry S. Truman and Gen.",

The wreck of Dashing Wave ( edit ) On July 29 , 1870 , the British tea clipper Dashing Wave , under the command of Captain Henry Vandervord , sailed out of Foochoo , China , en route to Sydney , Australia . On August 31 `` the weather was very thick , and it was blowing a heavy gale from the eastward , attended with violent squalls , and a tremendous sea . '' At 10 : 30 p.m. breakers were seen and the ship struck the reef at Wake Island . Overnight the vessel began to break up and at 10 : 00 a.m. the crew succeeded in launching the longboat over the leeward side . In the chaos of the evacuation , the captain secured a chart and nautical instruments , but no compass . The crew loaded a case of wine , some bread and two buckets , but no drinking water . Since Wake Island appeared to have neither food nor water , the captain and his 12 - man crew quickly departed , crafting a makeshift sail by attaching a blanket to an oar . With no water , each man was allotted a glass of wine per day until a heavy rain shower came on the sixth day . After 31 days of hardship , drifting westward in the longboat , they reached Kosrae ( Strong 's Island ) in the Caroline Islands . Capt . Vandervord attributed the loss of Dashing Wave to the erroneous manner in which Wake Island `` is laid down in the charts . It is very low , and not easily seen even on a clear night . '' American possession ( edit ) With the annexation of Hawaii in 1898 and the seizure of Guam and the Philippines during the Spanish -- American War that same year , the United States began to consider unclaimed and uninhabited Wake Island , located approximately halfway between Honolulu and Manila , as a good location for a telegraph cable station and coaling station for refueling warships of the rapidly expanding United States Navy and passing merchant and passenger steamships . On July 4 , 1898 , United States Army Brigadier General Francis V. Greene of the 2nd Brigade , Philippine Expeditionary Force , of the Eighth Army Corps , stopped at Wake Island and raised the American flag while en route to the Philippines on the steamship liner SS China . Commander Edward D. Taussig of USS Bennington takes formal possession of Wake Island for the United States with the raising of the flag and a 21 - gun salute on January 17 , 1899 . On January 17 , 1899 , under orders from President William McKinley , Commander Edward D. Taussig of USS Bennington landed on Wake and formally took possession of the island for the United States . After a 21 - gun salute , the flag was raised and a brass plate was affixed to the flagstaff with the following inscription : United States of America William McKinley , President ; John D. Long , Secretary of the Navy . Commander Edward D. Taussig , U.S.N. , Commander U.S.S. Bennington , this 17th day of January , 1899 , took possession of the Atoll known as Wake Island for the United States of America . Although the proposed route for the submarine cable would be shorter by 137 miles , Midway and not Wake Island was chosen as the location for the telegraph cable station between Honolulu and Guam . Rear Admiral Royal Bird Bradford , chief of the U.S. Navy 's Bureau of Equipment , stated before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce on January 17 , 1902 , that `` Wake Island seems at times to be swept by the sea . It is only a few feet above the level of the ocean , and if a cable station were established there very expensive works would be required ; besides it has no harbor , while the Midway Islands are perfectly habitable and have a fair harbor for vessels of eighteen feet draught . '' On June 23 , 1902 , USAT Buford , commanded by Captain Alfred Croskey and bound for Manila , spotted a ship 's boat on the beach as it passed closely by Wake Island . Soon thereafter the boat was launched by Japanese on the island and sailed out to meet the transport . The Japanese told Captain Croskey that they had been put on the island by a schooner from Yokohama in Japan and that they were gathering guano and drying fish . The captain suspected that they were also engaged in pearl hunting .",

It initially aired on Fox from June 11 , 2002 to April 7 , 2016 for 15 seasons . On March 11 , 2018 , the 16th season made its debut on ABC . It started as an addition to the Idols format that was based on Pop Idol from British television , and became one of the most successful shows in the history of American television . The concept of the series involves discovering recording stars from unsigned singing talents , with the winner determined by American viewers using phones , Internet , and SMS text voting . The winners of the first fifteen seasons , as chosen by viewers , are Kelly Clarkson , Ruben Studdard , Fantasia , Carrie Underwood , Taylor Hicks , Jordin Sparks , David Cook , Kris Allen , Lee DeWyze , Scotty McCreery , Phillip Phillips , Candice Glover , Caleb Johnson , Nick Fradiani , and Trent Harmon . American Idol employs a panel of vocal judges who critique the contestants ' performances . The original judges , for seasons one through eight , were record producer and music manager Randy Jackson , singer and choreographer Paula Abdul , and music executive and manager Simon Cowell . The judging panel for seasons 13 , 14 , and 15 on Fox consisted of singers Keith Urban , Jennifer Lopez , and Harry Connick , Jr . Season 16 brought three entirely new judges : singers Lionel Richie , Katy Perry , and Luke Bryan . The first season was hosted by radio personality Ryan Seacrest and comedian Brian Dunkleman , but Seacrest remained as the sole master of ceremonies for the rest of the series . The success of American Idol has been described as `` unparalleled in broadcasting history '' . A rival TV executive said the series was `` the most impactful show in the history of television '' . It became a recognized springboard for launching the career of many artists as bona fide stars .",

The save was not activated in the twelfth season and consequently , a non-elimination took place in the week after its expiration with the votes then carrying over into the following week . The `` Fan Save '' was introduced in the fourteenth season . During the finals , viewers were given a five - minute window to vote for the contestants in danger of elimination by using their Twitter account to decide which contestant will move on to the next show , starting with the Top 8 . Season finale ( edit ) The finale was the two - hour last episode of the season , culminating in revealing the winner . For seasons one , three through six , fourteen , and fifteen it was broadcast from the Dolby Theatre , which has an audience capacity of approximately 3,400 . The finale for season two took place at the Gibson Amphitheatre , which has an audience capacity of over 6,000 . In seasons seven through thirteen , the venue was at the Nokia Theater , which holds an audience of over 7,000 . Rewards for winner and finalists ( edit ) The winner received a record deal with a major label , which may be for up to six albums , and secures a management contract with American Idol - affiliated 19 Management ( which has the right of first refusal to sign all contestants ) , as well as various lucrative contracts . All winners prior to season nine reportedly earned at least $1 million in their first year as winner . All the runners - up of the first ten seasons , as well as some of other finalists , had also received record deals with major labels . However , starting in season 11 , the runner - up may only be guaranteed a single - only deal . BMG / Sony ( seasons 1 -- 9 ) and UMG ( season 10 -- 15 ) had the right of first refusal to sign contestants for three months after the season 's finale . Starting in the fourteenth season , the winner was signed with Big Machine Records . Prominent music mogul Clive Davis also produced some of the selected contestants ' albums , such as Kelly Clarkson , Clay Aiken , Fantasia Barrino and Diana DeGarmo . All top 10 ( 11 in seasons 10 and 12 ) finalists earn the privilege of going on a tour , where the participants may each earn a six - figure sum . Series overview and season synopses ( edit ) Main article : List of American Idol episodes Each season premiered with the audition round , taking place in different cities . The audition episodes typically feature a mix of potential finalists , interesting characters and woefully inadequate contestants . Each successful contestant received a golden ticket to proceed on to the next round in Hollywood . Based on their performances during the Hollywood round ( Las Vegas round for seasons 10 onward ) , 24 to 36 contestants were selected by the judges to participate in the semifinals . From the semifinals onward the contestants performed their songs live , with the judges making their critiques after each performance . The contestants were voted for by the viewing public , and the outcome of the public votes was then revealed in the results show typically on the following night . The results shows featured group performances by the contestants as well as guest performers . The Top - three results show also featured the homecoming events for the Top 3 finalists . The season reaches its climax in a two - hour results finale show , where the winner of the season was revealed . With the exception of seasons one and two , the contestants in the semifinals onward performed in front of a studio audience . They performed with a full band in the finals . From season four to season nine , and season thirteen onward , the American Idol band was led by Rickey Minor ; from season ten to season twelve , Ray Chew . Assistance may also have been given by vocal coaches and song arrangers , such as Michael Orland and Debra Byrd to contestants behind the scene . Starting with season seven , contestants may perform with a musical instrument from the Hollywood rounds onward . In the first nine seasons , performances were usually aired live on Tuesday nights , followed by the results shows on Wednesdays in the United States and Canada , but moved to Wednesdays and Thursdays in season ten .",

The first show drew 9.9 million viewers , giving Fox the best viewing figure for the 8.30 pm spot in over a year . The audience steadily grew , and by finale night , the audience had averaged 23 million , with more than 40 million watching some part of that show . That episode was placed third amongst all age groups , but more importantly it led in the in 18 -- 49 demographic , the age group most valued by advertisers . The growth continued into the next season , starting with a season premiere of 26.5 million . The season attracted an average of 21.7 million viewers , and was placed second overall amongst the 18 -- 49 age group . The finale night when Ruben Studdard won over Clay Aiken was also the highest - rated ever American Idol episode at 38.1 million for the final hour . By season three , the show had become the top show in the 18 -- 49 demographic a position it has held for all subsequent years up to and including season ten , and its competition stages ranked first in the nationwide overall ratings . By season four , American Idol had become the most watched series amongst all viewers on American TV for the first time , with an average viewership of 26.8 million . The show reached its peak in season five with numbers averaging 30.6 million per episode , and season five remains the highest - rated season of the series . Season six premiered with the series ' highest - rated debut episode and a few of its succeeding episodes rank among the most watched episodes of American Idol . During this time , many television executives begun to regard the show as a programming force unlike any seen before , as its consistent dominance of up to two hours two or three nights a week exceeded the 30 - or 60 - minute reach of previous hits such as NBC 's The Cosby Show . The show was dubbed `` the Death Star '' , and competing networks often rearranged their schedules in order to minimize losses . However , season six also showed a steady decline in viewership over the course of the season . The season finale saw a drop in ratings of 16 % from the previous year . Season six was the first season wherein the average results show rated higher than the competition stages ( unlike in the previous seasons ) , and became the second - highest - rated of the series after the preceding season . The loss of viewers continued into season seven . The premiere was down 11 % among total viewers , and the results show in which Kristy Lee Cook was eliminated delivered its lowest - rated Wednesday show among the 18 -- 34 demo since the first season in 2002 . However , the ratings rebounded for the season seven finale with the excitement over the battle of the Davids , and improved over season six as the series ' third most watched finale . The strong finish of season seven also helped Fox become the most watched TV network in the country for the first time since its inception , a first ever in American television history for a non-Big Three major broadcast network .",

Electrical activity Brain electrical activity recorded from a human patient during an epileptic seizure . As a side effect of the electrochemical processes used by neurons for signaling , brain tissue generates electric fields when it is active . When large numbers of neurons show synchronized activity , the electric fields that they generate can be large enough to detect outside the skull , using electroencephalography ( EEG ) or magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) . EEG recordings , along with recordings made from electrodes implanted inside the brains of animals such as rats , show that the brain of a living animal is constantly active , even during sleep . Each part of the brain shows a mixture of rhythmic and nonrhythmic activity , which may vary according to behavioral state . In mammals , the cerebral cortex tends to show large slow delta waves during sleep , faster alpha waves when the animal is awake but inattentive , and chaotic - looking irregular activity when the animal is actively engaged in a task . During an epileptic seizure , the brain 's inhibitory control mechanisms fail to function and electrical activity rises to pathological levels , producing EEG traces that show large wave and spike patterns not seen in a healthy brain . Relating these population - level patterns to the computational functions of individual neurons is a major focus of current research in neurophysiology . Metabolism All vertebrates have a blood -- brain barrier that allows metabolism inside the brain to operate differently from metabolism in other parts of the body . Glial cells play a major role in brain metabolism by controlling the chemical composition of the fluid that surrounds neurons , including levels of ions and nutrients . Brain tissue consumes a large amount of energy in proportion to its volume , so large brains place severe metabolic demands on animals . The need to limit body weight in order , for example , to fly , has apparently led to selection for a reduction of brain size in some species , such as bats . Most of the brain 's energy consumption goes into sustaining the electric charge ( membrane potential ) of neurons . Most vertebrate species devote between 2 % and 8 % of basal metabolism to the brain . In primates , however , the percentage is much higher -- in humans it rises to 20 -- 25 % . The energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time , but active regions of the cerebral cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions ; this forms the basis for the functional brain imaging methods PET , fMRI , and NIRS . The brain typically gets most of its energy from oxygen - dependent metabolism of glucose ( i.e. , blood sugar ) , but ketones provide a major alternative source , together with contributions from medium chain fatty acids ( caprylic and heptanoic acids ) , lactate , acetate , and possibly amino acids . Functions Model of a neural circuit in the cerebellum , as proposed by James S. Albus . Information from the sense organs is collected in the brain . There it is used to determine what actions the organism is to take . The brain processes the raw data to extract information about the structure of the environment . Next it combines the processed information with information about the current needs of the animal and with memory of past circumstances . Finally , on the basis of the results , it generates motor response patterns . These signal - processing tasks require intricate interplay between a variety of functional subsystems . The function of the brain is to provide coherent control over the actions of an animal . A centralized brain allows groups of muscles to be co-activated in complex patterns ; it also allows stimuli impinging on one part of the body to evoke responses in other parts , and it can prevent different parts of the body from acting at cross-purposes to each other . Perception Diagram of signal processing in the auditory system . The human brain is provided with information about light , sound , the chemical composition of the atmosphere , temperature , head orientation , limb position , the chemical composition of the bloodstream , and more . In other animals additional senses are present , such as the infrared heat - sense of snakes , the magnetic field sense of some birds , or the electric field sense of some types of fish . Each sensory system begins with specialized receptor cells , such as light - receptive neurons in the retina of the eye , or vibration - sensitive neurons in the cochlea of the ear . The axons of sensory receptor cells travel into the spinal cord or brain , where they transmit their signals to a first - order sensory nucleus dedicated to one specific sensory modality . This primary sensory nucleus sends information to higher - order sensory areas that are dedicated to the same modality .",

The ship carried a total of 16 lifeboat davits which could lower three lifeboats each , for a total of 48 boats . However , Titanic carried only a total of 20 lifeboats , four of which were collapsible and proved to be hard to launch during the sinking . After leaving Southampton on 10 April 1912 , Titanic called at Cherbourg in France and Queenstown ( now Cobh ) in Ireland before heading west to New York . On 14 April , four days into the crossing and about 375 miles ( 600 km ) south of Newfoundland , she hit an iceberg at 11 : 40 p.m. ship 's time . The collision caused the ship 's hull plates to buckle inwards along her starboard ( right ) side and opened five of her sixteen watertight compartments to the sea ; she could only survive four flooding . Meanwhile , passengers and some crew members were evacuated in lifeboats , many of which were launched only partially loaded . A disproportionate number of men were left aboard because of a `` women and children first '' protocol for loading lifeboats . At 2 : 20 a.m. , she broke apart and foundered -- with well over one thousand people still aboard . Just under two hours after the Titanic sank , the Cunard liner RMS Carpathia arrived at the scene , where she brought aboard an estimated 705 survivors . The disaster was met with worldwide shock and outrage at the huge loss of life and the regulatory and operational failures that had led to it . Public inquiries in Britain and the United States led to major improvements in maritime safety . One of their most important legacies was the establishment in 1914 of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea ( SOLAS ) , which still governs maritime safety today . Additionally , several new wireless regulations were passed around the world in an effort to learn from the many missteps in wireless communications -- which could have saved many more passengers . The wreck of Titanic was first discovered in 1985 ( more than 70 years after the disaster ) , and the vessel remains on the seabed . The ship was split in two and is gradually disintegrating at a depth of 12,415 feet ( 3,784 m ) . Since her discovery in 1985 , thousands of artefacts have been recovered and put on display at museums around the world . Titanic has become one of the most famous ships in history ; her memory is kept alive by numerous works of popular culture , including books , folk songs , films , exhibits , and memorials . Titanic is the second largest ocean liner wreck in the world , only beaten by her sister HMHS Britannic , the largest ever sunk .

Built in Belfast , Ireland , in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ( as it was then known ) , the RMS Titanic was the second of the three Olympic - class ocean liners -- the first was the RMS Olympic and the third was the HMHS Britannic . They were by far the largest vessels of the British shipping company White Star Line 's fleet , which comprised 29 steamers and tenders in 1912 .

There were an estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard the ship , and more than 1,500 died , making it one of the deadliest commercial peacetime maritime disasters in modern history . The RMS Titanic was the largest ship afloat at the time it entered service and was the second of three Olympic - class ocean liners operated by the White Star Line . The Titanic was built by the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast . Thomas Andrews , her architect , died in the disaster . Titanic was under the command of Edward Smith , who also went down with the ship . The ocean liner carried some of the wealthiest people in the world , as well as hundreds of emigrants from Great Britain and Ireland , Scandinavia and elsewhere throughout Europe who were seeking a new life in the United States . The first - class accommodation was designed to be the pinnacle of comfort and luxury , with an on - board gymnasium , swimming pool , libraries , high - class restaurants and opulent cabins . A high - powered radiotelegraph transmitter was available for sending passenger `` marconigrams '' and for the ship 's operational use . Although Titanic had advanced safety features such as watertight compartments and remotely activated watertight doors , there were not enough lifeboats to accommodate all of those aboard , due to outdated maritime safety regulations . Titanic only carried enough lifeboats for 1,178 people -- slightly more than half of the number on board , and one third of her total capacity . The ship carried a total of 16 lifeboat davits which could lower three lifeboats each , for a total of 48 boats . However , Titanic carried only a total of 20 lifeboats , four of which were collapsible and proved to be hard to launch during the sinking . After leaving Southampton on 10 April 1912 , Titanic called at Cherbourg in France and Queenstown ( now Cobh ) in Ireland before heading west to New York . On 14 April , four days into the crossing and about 375 miles ( 600 km ) south of Newfoundland , she hit an iceberg at 11 : 40 p.m.",

Fisher also won the 1997 NIT tournament with a team that compiled a 25 -- 9 overall ( 11 -- 5 ) record . Many of Fisher 's accomplishments were tarnished by NCAA sanctions . He left the job due to the University of Michigan basketball scandal . Ellerbe era ( 1997 -- 2001 ) ( edit ) Brian Ellerbe assumed the title of interim coach less than five months after becoming an assistant coach . He was named full - time coach following the 25 -- 9 ( 11 -- 5 ) 1997 -- 98 season in which he led the team to victories over Iowa , Minnesota and Purdue to capture the Big Ten Conference Men 's Basketball Tournament championship . His subsequent teams never finished better than seventh in the conference . Amaker era ( 2001 -- 07 ) ( edit ) Tommy Amaker inherited a team that imposed sanctions on itself after his first year at the helm of the program . Nonetheless , he coached the team to the postseason three times including both an NIT championship in 2004 and a runner - up finish in 2006 . During the 2005 -- 06 , when the team compiled a 22 -- 11 overall ( 8 -- 8 , Big Ten ) record , he led them to their first national ranking in eight years when they reached the # 20 position . Despite his successes , the team never won a Big Ten Championship and never made the NCAA tournament , which led to his firing after six seasons . Beilein era ( 2007 -- present ) ( edit ) John Beilein 's 10 -- 22 overall ( 5 -- 13 Big Ten ) inaugural season featured the most losses in Michigan 's history . However , in Beilein 's second season , the team posted impressive non-conference victories over top - five ranked opponents UCLA and Duke . Beilein led Michigan to the 2009 NCAA Tournament , its first appearance since 1998 and the first that was not vacated since 1995 . After upsetting Clemson in the first round , the Wolverines were eliminated by Oklahoma in Round 2 by a final score of 73 -- 63 . Following a disappointing 15 -- 17 season in 2009 -- 10 , the Wolverines bounced back to return to the NCAA Tournament in 2011 , advancing to the round of 32 before losing to top - seeded Duke , 73 -- 71 . The 2010 -- 11 Wolverines , who swept rival Michigan State for the first time since 1997 , finished the season 21 -- 14 . In the 2011 -- 12 season , Michigan split the season series with both Ohio State and Michigan State and went on to be co-Big Ten champs along with the Buckeyes and Spartans . It was the program 's first Big Ten title for Michigan since 1986 . The Wolverines finished the season 24 - 10 and 13 - 5 in conference play , losing in the opening round of the NCAA Tournament . The 2012 -- 13 Michigan team earned a # 1 ranking in the AP Poll on January 28 , 2013 , marking the first time since November 30 , 1992 , that Michigan held that position . The team also made program history for the best season start , at 21 -- 2 . On March 31 , The Wolverines defeated Florida by a score of 79 -- 59 to make their first Final Four appearance since the 1992 -- 93 season . The Wolverines then defeated Syracuse by a score of 61 -- 56 in the Final Four . In the 2013 National Championship game , the Wolverines lost against Louisville by the score of 82 -- 76 . The 2013 -- 14 team had another strong season , winning Michigan 's first outright Big Ten championship since 1986 and advancing to the Elite Eight of the NCAA tournament , where it lost to Kentucky , 75 -- 72 . During the 2016 -- 17 season , Beilein became the winningest coach in school history , passing Johnny Orr with his 210th win , 75 -- 55 over Illinois on March 9 in the opening round of the 2017 Big Ten Tournament .",

Retains death penalty Abolished for any offence Capital punishment is a legal penalty in the United States , currently used by 31 states , the federal government , and the military . Its existence can be traced to the beginning of the American colonies . The United States is the only Western country currently applying the death penalty , one of 57 countries worldwide applying it , and was the first to develop lethal injection as a method of execution , which has since been adopted by five other countries . There were no executions in the United States between 1967 and 1977 . In 1972 , the U.S. Supreme Court struck down capital punishment statutes in Furman v. Georgia , reducing all death sentences pending at the time to life imprisonment . Subsequently , a majority of states passed new death penalty statutes , and the court affirmed the legality of capital punishment in the 1976 case Gregg v. Georgia . Since then , more than 7,800 defendants have been sentenced to death ; of these , more than 1,400 have been executed , 161 who were sentenced to death before and after 1976 were exonerated of their conviction before their execution in the modern era. and more than 2,900 are still on death row .

The Bill of Rights adopted in 1789 included the Eighth Amendment which prohibited cruel and unusual punishment . The Fifth Amendment was drafted with language implying a possible use of the death penalty , requiring a grand jury indictment for `` capital crime '' and a due process of law for deprivation of `` life '' by the government . The Fourteenth Amendment adopted in 1868 also requires a due process of law for deprivation of life by any state . The Espy file , compiled by M. Watt Espy and John Ortiz Smykla , lists 15,269 people executed in the United States and its predecessor colonies between 1608 and 1991 . From 1930 to 2002 , there were 4,661 executions in the U.S. , about two - thirds of them in the first 20 years . Additionally , the United States Army executed 135 soldiers between 1916 and 1955 ( the most recent ) .

Until then , `` save for a few mavericks , no one gave any credence to the possibility of ending the death penalty by judicial interpretation of constitutional law '' , according to abolitionist Hugo Bedau . The possibility of challenging the constitutionality of the death penalty became progressively more realistic after the Supreme Court of the United States decided Trop v. Dulles in 1958 , when the court said explicitly for the first time that the Eighth Amendment 's cruel and unusual clause must draw its meaning from the `` evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society '' , rather than from its original meaning . Also in the 1932 case Powell v. Alabama , the court made the first step of what would be later be called `` death is different '' jurisprudence , when it held that any indigent defendant was entitled to a court - appointed attorney in capital cases - a right that was only later extended to non-capital defendants in 1963 , with Gideon v. Wainwright . Capital punishment suspended ( 1972 ) ( edit ) Further information : Furman v. Georgia Executions in the United States since 1960 In Furman v. Georgia , the U.S. Supreme Court considered a group of consolidated cases . The lead case involved an individual convicted under Georgia 's death penalty statute , which featured a `` unitary trial '' procedure in which the jury was asked to return a verdict of guilt or innocence and , simultaneously , determine whether the defendant would be punished by death or life imprisonment . The last pre-Furman execution was that of Luis Monge on June 2 , 1967 . In a 5 - 4 decision , the Supreme Court struck down the impositions of the death penalty in each of the consolidated cases as unconstitutional in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution . The Supreme Court has never ruled the death penalty to be per se unconstitutional . The five justices in the majority did not produce a common opinion or rationale for their decision , however , and agreed only on a short statement announcing the result . The narrowest opinions , those of Byron White and Potter Stewart , expressed generalized concerns about the inconsistent application of the death penalty across a variety of cases , but did not exclude the possibility of a constitutional death penalty law . Stewart and William O. Douglas worried explicitly about racial discrimination in enforcement of the death penalty . Thurgood Marshall and William J. Brennan Jr. expressed the opinion that the death penalty was proscribed absolutely by the Eighth Amendment as cruel and unusual punishment . The Furman decision caused all death sentences pending at the time to be reduced to life imprisonment , and was described by scholars as a `` legal bombshell '' . The next day , columnist Barry Schweid wrote that it was `` unlikely '' that the death penalty could exist anymore in the United States . Capital punishment reinstated ( 1976 ) ( edit ) Further information : Gregg v. Georgia U.S. Supreme Court seat in Washington , D.C.",

Religious groups are widely split on the issue of capital punishment . The Fiqh Council of North America , a group of highly influential Muslim scholars in the United States , has issued a fatwa calling for a moratorium on capital punishment in the United States until various preconditions in the legal system are met . In October 2009 , the American Law Institute voted to disavow the framework for capital punishment that it had created in 1962 , as part of the Model Penal Code , `` in light of the current intractable institutional and structural obstacles to ensuring a minimally adequate system for administering capital punishment '' . A study commissioned by the institute had said that experience had proved that the goal of individualized decisions about who should be executed and the goal of systemic fairness for minorities and others could not be reconciled . As of 2017 , 159 prisoners have been exonerated due to evidence of their innocence . Advocates of the death penalty say that it deters crime , is a good tool for prosecutors in plea bargaining , improves the community by eliminating recidivism by executed criminals , provides `` closure '' to surviving victims or loved ones , and is a just penalty . The murder rate is highest in the South ( 6.5 per 100,000 in 2016 ) , where 80 % of executions are carried out , and lowest in the Northeast ( 3.5 per 100,000 ) , with less than 1 % of executions . A report by the US National Research Council in 2012 stated that studies claiming a deterrent effect are `` fundamentally flawed '' and should not be used for policy decisions . According to a survey of the former and present presidents of the country 's top academic criminological societies , 88 % of these experts rejected the notion that the death penalty acts as a deterrent to murder . ( Radelet & Lacock , 2009 ) Data shows that the application of the death penalty is strongly influenced by racial bias . Furthermore , some opponents argue that it is applied in an arbitrary manner by a criminal justice system that has been shown to be biased through the systemic influence of socio - economic , geographic , and gender factors . Another argument in the capital punishment debate is the cost . Clemency and commutations ( edit ) The largest number of clemencies was granted in January 2003 in Illinois when outgoing Governor George Ryan , who had already imposed a moratorium on executions , pardoned four death - row inmates and commuted the sentences of the remaining 167 to life in prison without the possibility of parole . When Governor Pat Quinn signed legislation abolishing the death penalty in Illinois in March 2011 , he commuted the sentences of the fifteen inmates on death row to life imprisonment . Previous post-Furman mass clemencies took place in 1986 in New Mexico , when Governor Toney Anaya commuted all death sentences because of his personal opposition to the death penalty . In 1991 , outgoing Ohio Governor Dick Celeste commuted the sentences of eight prisoners , among them all four women on the state 's death row . And during his two terms ( 1979 - 1987 ) as Florida 's Governor , Bob Graham , although a strong death penalty supporter who had overseen the first post-Furman involuntary execution as well as 15 others , agreed to commute the sentences of six people on the grounds of doubts about guilt or disproportionality . Execution hiatus ( edit ) All executions were suspended through the country between September 2007 and April 2008 . At that time , the U.S. Supreme Court was examining the constitutionality of lethal injection in Baze v. Rees . This was the longest period with no executions in the United States since 1982 . The Supreme Court ultimately upheld this method in a 7 - 2 ruling .",

Other eclipses over the United States ( edit ) This was the first total solar eclipse visible from the United States since that of July 11 , 1991 -- which was seen only from part of Hawaii -- and the first visible from the contiguous United States since 1979 . An eclipse of comparable length ( up to 3 minutes , 8 seconds , with the longest eclipse being 6 minutes and 54 seconds ) occurred over the contiguous United States on March 7 , 1970 along the southern portions of the Eastern Seaboard , from Florida to Virginia . The path of totality of the solar eclipse of February 26 , 1979 crossed only the states of Washington , Oregon , Idaho , Montana , and North Dakota . Many enthusiasts traveled to the Pacific Northwest to view the eclipse , since it would be the last chance to view such an eclipse in the contiguous United States for almost four decades . Some American scientists and interested amateurs who wanted to experience a total eclipse participated in a four - day Atlantic Ocean cruise to view the solar eclipse of July 10 , 1972 as it passed near Nova Scotia . ( This is referenced in the Carly Simon hit song `` You 're So Vain '' in the lyric , `` Then you flew your Lear Jet up to Nova Scotia to see the total eclipse of the Sun . '' ) Organizers of the cruise advertised in astronomical journals and in planetarium announcements , emphasizing the rarity of the event . The path of totality across the United States The August 2017 eclipse was the first with a path of totality crossing the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of the U.S. since 1918 . Also , its path of totality made landfall exclusively within the United States , making it the first such eclipse since the country 's declaration of independence in 1776 . Prior to this , the path of totality of the eclipse of June 13 , 1257 , was the last to make landfall exclusively on lands currently part of the United States . The path of the 2017 eclipse crosses with the path of the upcoming total solar eclipse of April 8 , 2024 , with the intersection of the two paths being in southern Illinois in Makanda Township at Cedar Lake , just south of Carbondale . An area of about 9,000 square miles , including the cities of Makanda , Carbondale , Cape Girardeau , Missouri , and Paducah , Kentucky , will thus experience two total solar eclipses within a span of less than seven years . The cities of Benton , Carbondale , Chester , Harrisburg , Marion , and Metropolis in Illinois ; Cape Girardeau , Farmington , and Perryville in Missouri , as well as Paducah , Kentucky , will also be in the path of the 2024 eclipse , thereby earning the distinction of witnessing two total solar eclipses in seven years . The solar eclipse of August 12 , 2045 will have a very similar path of totality over the U.S. to the 2017 eclipse : about 400 km ( 250 mi ) to the southwest , also crossing the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of the country ; however , totality will be more than twice as long .",

In 1847 he submitted to the U.S. Congress a `` Proposal for a Charter to Build a Railroad from Lake Michigan to the Pacific Ocean '' , seeking a congressional charter to support his idea . Preliminary exploration ( edit ) The official poster announcing the Pacific Railroad 's grand opening . Congress agreed to support the idea . Under the direction of the Department of War , the Pacific Railroad Surveys were conducted from 1853 through 1855 . These included an extensive series of expeditions of the American West seeking possible routes . A report on the explorations described alternative routes and included an immense amount of information about the American West , covering at least 400,000 sq mi ( 1,000,000 km ) . It included the region 's natural history and illustrations of reptiles , amphibians , birds , and mammals . The report failed however to include detailed topographic maps of potential routes needed to estimate the feasibility , cost and select the best route . The survey was detailed enough to determine that the best southern route lay south of the Gila River boundary with Mexico in mostly vacant desert , through the future territories of Arizona and New Mexico . This in part motivated the United States to complete the Gadsden Purchase . In 1856 the Select Committee on the Pacific Railroad and Telegraph of the US House of Representatives published a report recommending support for a proposed Pacific railroad bill : The necessity that now exists for constructing lines of railroad and telegraphic communication between the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of this continent is no longer a question for argument ; it is conceded by every one . In order to maintain our present position on the Pacific , we must have some more speedy and direct means of intercourse than is at present afforded by the route through the possessions of a foreign power . Possible routes ( edit ) The U.S. Congress was strongly divided on where the eastern terminus of the railroad should be -- in a southern or northern city . Three routes were considered : A northern route roughly along the Missouri River through present - day northern Montana to Oregon Territory . This was considered impractical due to the rough terrain and extensive winter snows . A central route following the Platte River in Nebraska through to the South Pass in Wyoming , following most of the Oregon Trail. Snow on this route remained a concern . A southern route across Texas , New Mexico Territory , the Sonora desert , connecting to Los Angeles , California . Surveyors found during a 1848 survey that the best route lay south of the border between the United States and Mexico . This was resolved by the Gadsden Purchase in 1853 . Once the central route was chosen , it was immediately obvious that the western terminus should be Sacramento . But there was considerable difference of opinion about the eastern terminus . Three locations along 250 miles ( 400 km ) of Missouri River were considered : St. Joseph , Missouri , accessed via the Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad . Kansas City , Kansas / Leavenworth , Kansas accessed via the Leavenworth , Pawnee and Western Railroad , controlled by Thomas Ewing Jr. and later by John C. Fremont . Council Bluffs , Iowa / Omaha , Nebraska , accessed via an extension of Union Pacific financier Thomas C. Durant 's proposed Mississippi and Missouri Railroad and the new Union Pacific Railroad , also controlled by Durant . Council Bluffs had several advantages : It was well north of the Civil War fighting in Missouri ; it was the shortest route to South Pass in the Rockies in Wyoming ; and it would follow a fertile river that would encourage settlement . Durant had hired Lincoln in 1857 when he was an attorney to represent him in a business matter about a bridge over the Missouri . Now Lincoln was responsible for choosing the eastern terminus , and he relied on Durant 's counsel . Durant advocated for Omaha , and he was so confident of the choice that he began buying up land in Nebraska . Key individuals ( edit ) Leland Stanford and the officers of the CPRR in 1870 Asa Whitney ( edit ) One of the most prominent champions of the central route railroad was Asa Whitney . He envisioned a route from Chicago and the Great Lakes to northern California , paid for by the sale of land to settlers along the route . Whitney traveled widely to solicit support from businessmen and politicians , printed maps and pamphlets , and submitted several proposals to Congress , all at his own expense .",

While not exactly accurate , John Ford 's 1924 silent movie The Iron Horse captures the fervent nationalism that drove public support for the project . Among the cooks serving the film 's cast and crew between shots were some of the Chinese laborers who worked on the Central Pacific section of the railroad . The 1962 film How the West Was Won has a whole segment devoted to the construction ; one of the movie 's most famous scenes , filmed in Cinerama , is of a buffalo stampede over the railroad . The construction of what presumably is -- or is suggested to be -- the Transcontinental Railroad provides the backdrop of the 1968 epic spaghetti western Once Upon a Time in the West , directed by Italian director Sergio Leone . Kristiana Gregory 's book The Great Railroad Race ( part of the `` Dear America '' series ) is written as the fictional diary of Libby West , who chronicles the end of the railroad construction and the excitement which engulfed the country at the time . Graham Masterton 's 1981 novel A Man of Destiny ( published in the UK as Railroad ) is a fictionalised account of the line 's construction . In the 1999 Will Smith film , Wild Wild West , the joining ceremony is the setting of an assassination attempt on then U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant by the film 's antagonist Dr. Miguelito Quixote Loveless . The building of the railway is covered by the 2004 BBC documentary series Seven Wonders of the Industrial World in episode 6 , `` The Line '' . The series American Experience also documents the railway in the episode titled `` Transcontinental Railroad '' . The main character in The Claim ( 2000 ) is a surveyor for the Central Pacific Railroad , and the film is partially about the efforts of a frontier mayor to have the railroad routed through his town . The popular British television show Doctor Who featured the Transcontinental Railroad in a BBC audio book entitled The Runaway Train , read by Matt Smith and written for audio by Oli Smith . The children 's book Ten Mile Day by Mary Ann Fraser tells the story of the record setting push by the Central Pacific in which they set a record by laying 10 miles ( 16 km ) of track in a single day on April 28 , 1869 , to settle a $10,000 bet .

Key individuals ( edit ) Leland Stanford and the officers of the CPRR in 1870 Asa Whitney ( edit ) One of the most prominent champions of the central route railroad was Asa Whitney . He envisioned a route from Chicago and the Great Lakes to northern California , paid for by the sale of land to settlers along the route . Whitney traveled widely to solicit support from businessmen and politicians , printed maps and pamphlets , and submitted several proposals to Congress , all at his own expense . In June 1845 , he led a team along part of the proposed route to assess its feasibility . Legislation to begin construction of the Pacific Railroad ( called the Memorial of Asa Whitney ) was first introduced to Congress by Representative Zadock Pratt . Congress did not immediately act on Whitney 's proposal . Theodore Judah ( edit ) Main article : Theodore Judah Theodore Judah , architect of the Transcontinental Railroad and first chief engineer of the Central Pacific . Lewis M. Clement , Chief Assistant Engineer and Superintendent of Track The next big champion of the central route was Theodore Judah , who undertook to survey a manageable route through what was one of the chief obstacles of a central route to California , the high and rugged Sierra Nevada . In 1852 , Judah was chief engineer for the newly formed Sacramento Valley Railroad , the first railroad built west of the Mississippi River . Although the railroad later went bankrupt once the easy placer gold deposits around Placerville , California were depleted , Judah was convinced that a properly financed railroad could pass from Sacramento through the Sierra Nevada mountains to reach the Great Basin and hook up with rail lines coming from the East . In 1856 , Judah wrote a 13,000 - word proposal in support of a Pacific railroad and distributed it to Cabinet secretaries , congressmen and other influential people . In September 1859 , Judah was chosen to be the accredited lobbyist for the Pacific Railroad Convention , which indeed approved his plan to survey , finance and engineer the road . Judah returned to Washington in December 1859 . He had a lobbying office in the United States Capitol , received an audience with President James Buchanan , and represented the Convention before Congress . Judah returned to California in 1860 . He continued to search for a more practical route through the Sierra suitable for a railroad . In mid-1860 , local miner Daniel Strong had surveyed a route over the Sierra for a wagon toll road , which he realized would also suit a railroad . He described his discovery in a letter to Judah . Together , they formed an association to solicit subscriptions from local merchants and businessmen to support their proposed railroad . From January or February 1861 until July , Judah and Strong led a 10 - person expedition to survey the route for the railroad over the Sierra Nevada through Clipper Gap and Emigrant Gap , over Donner Pass , and south to Truckee . They discovered a way across the Sierras that was gradual enough to be made suitable for a railroad , although it still needed a lot of work . The Big four ( edit ) Main articles : The Big Four and Central Pacific Railroad Leland Stanford 's official gubernatorial portrait Four northern California businessmen formed the Central Pacific Railroad : Leland Stanford , ( 1824 -- 1893 ) , President ; Collis Potter Huntington , ( 1821 -- 1900 ) , Vice President ; Mark Hopkins , ( 1813 -- 1878 ) , Treasurer ; Charles Crocker , ( 1822 -- 1888 ) , Construction Supervisor . All became substantially wealthy from their association with the railroad . Thomas Durant ( edit ) Main articles : Thomas C. Durant and Union Pacific Railroad Dr. Thomas C. Durant Former ophthalmologist Dr. Thomas Clark `` Doc '' Durant was nominally only a vice president of Union Pacific , so he installed a series of respected men like John Adams Dix as president of the railroad . Durant and its financing arrangements were , unlike those of the CPRR , mired in controversy and scandals . Authorization and funding ( edit ) Main article : Pacific Railroad Act In February 1860 , Iowa Representative Samuel Curtis introduced a bill to fund the railroad . It passed the House but died when it could not be reconciled with the Senate version due to opposition from southern states who wanted a southern route near the 42nd parallel .

          "full_text": "This indicates that one or more supernovae must have occurred near the location where the Sun formed . A shock wave from a nearby supernova would have triggered the formation of the Sun by compressing the matter within the molecular cloud and causing certain regions to collapse under their own gravity . As one fragment of the cloud collapsed it also began to rotate because of conservation of angular momentum and heat up with the increasing pressure . Much of the mass became concentrated in the center , whereas the rest flattened out into a disk that would become the planets and other Solar System bodies . Gravity and pressure within the core of the cloud generated a lot of heat as it accreted more matter from the surrounding disk , eventually triggering nuclear fusion . Thus , the Sun was born . Main sequence Evolution of the Sun 's luminosity , radius and effective temperature compared to the present Sun . After Ribas ( 2010 ) The Sun is about halfway through its main - sequence stage , during which nuclear fusion reactions in its core fuse hydrogen into helium . Each second , more than four million tonnes of matter are converted into energy within the Sun 's core , producing neutrinos and solar radiation . At this rate , the Sun has so far converted around 100 times the mass of Earth into energy , about 0.03 % of the total mass of the Sun . The Sun will spend a total of approximately 10 billion years as a main - sequence star . The Sun is gradually becoming hotter during its time on the main sequence , because the helium atoms in the core occupy less volume than the hydrogen atoms that were fused . The core is therefore shrinking , allowing the outer layers of the Sun to move closer to the centre and experience a stronger gravitational force , according to the inverse - square law . This stronger force increases the pressure on the core , which is resisted by a gradual increase in the rate at which fusion occurs . This process speeds up as the core gradually becomes denser . It is estimated that the Sun has become 30 % brighter in the last 4.5 billion years . At present , it is increasing in brightness by about 1 % every 100 million years . After core hydrogen exhaustion The size of the current Sun ( now in the main sequence ) compared to its estimated size during its red - giant phase in the future The Sun does not have enough mass to explode as a supernova . Instead it will exit the main sequence in approximately 5 billion years and start to turn into a red giant . As a red giant , the Sun will grow so large that it will engulf Mercury , Venus , and probably Earth . Even before it becomes a red giant , the luminosity of the Sun will have nearly doubled , and Earth will receive as much sunlight as Venus receives today . Once the core hydrogen is exhausted in 5.4 billion years , the Sun will expand into a subgiant phase and slowly double in size over about half a billion years . It will then expand more rapidly over about half a billion years until it is over two hundred times larger than today and a couple of thousand times more luminous . This then starts the red - giant - branch phase where the Sun will spend around a billion years and lose around a third of its mass . Evolution of a Sun - like star . The track of a one solar mass star on the Hertzsprung -- Russell diagram is shown from the main sequence to the post-asymptotic - giant - branch stage . After the red - giant branch the Sun has approximately 120 million years of active life left , but much happens . First , the core , full of degenerate helium ignites violently in the helium flash , where it is estimated that 6 % of the core , itself 40 % of the Sun 's mass , will be converted into carbon within a matter of minutes through the triple - alpha process . The Sun then shrinks to around 10 times its current size and 50 times the luminosity , with a temperature a little lower than today . It will then have reached the red clump or horizontal branch , but a star of the Sun 's mass does not evolve blueward along the horizontal branch . Instead , it just becomes moderately larger and more luminous over about 100 million years as it continues to burn helium in the core . When the helium is exhausted , the Sun will repeat the expansion it followed when the hydrogen in the core was exhausted , except that this time it all happens faster , and the Sun becomes larger and more luminous . This is the asymptotic - giant - branch phase , and the Sun is alternately burning hydrogen in a shell or helium in a deeper shell .",

This is the asymptotic - giant - branch phase , and the Sun is alternately burning hydrogen in a shell or helium in a deeper shell . After about 20 million years on the early asymptotic giant branch , the Sun becomes increasingly unstable , with rapid mass loss and thermal pulses that increase the size and luminosity for a few hundred years every 100,000 years or so . The thermal pulses become larger each time , with the later pulses pushing the luminosity to as much as 5,000 times the current level and the radius to over 1 AU . According to a 2008 model , Earth 's orbit is shrinking due to tidal forces ( and , eventually , drag from the lower chromosphere ) , so that it will be engulfed by the Sun near the tip of the red giant branch phase , 1 and 3.8 million years after Mercury and Venus have respectively suffered the same fate . Models vary depending on the rate and timing of mass loss . Models that have higher mass loss on the red - giant branch produce smaller , less luminous stars at the tip of the asymptotic giant branch , perhaps only 2,000 times the luminosity and less than 200 times the radius . For the Sun , four thermal pulses are predicted before it completely loses its outer envelope and starts to make a planetary nebula . By the end of that phase -- lasting approximately 500,000 years -- the Sun will only have about half of its current mass . The post-asymptotic - giant - branch evolution is even faster . The luminosity stays approximately constant as the temperature increases , with the ejected half of the Sun 's mass becoming ionised into a planetary nebula as the exposed core reaches 30,000 K . The final naked core , a white dwarf , will have a temperature of over 100,000 K , and contain an estimated 54.05 % of the Sun 's present day mass . The planetary nebula will disperse in about 10,000 years , but the white dwarf will survive for trillions of years before fading to a hypothetical black dwarf . Motion and location Illustration of the Milky Way , showing the location of the Sun The Sun lies close to the inner rim of the Milky Way 's Orion Arm , in the Local Interstellar Cloud or the Gould Belt , at a distance of 7.5 -- 8.5 kpc ( 25,000 -- 28,000 light - years ) from the Galactic Center . The Sun is contained within the Local Bubble , a space of rarefied hot gas , possibly produced by the supernova remnant Geminga , or multiple supernovae in subgroup B1 of the Pleiades moving group . The distance between the local arm and the next arm out , the Perseus Arm , is about 6,500 light - years . The Sun , and thus the Solar System , is found in what scientists call the galactic habitable zone . The Apex of the Sun 's Way , or the solar apex , is the direction that the Sun travels relative to other nearby stars . This motion is towards a point in the constellation Hercules , near the star Vega . Of the 50 nearest stellar systems within 17 light - years from Earth ( the closest being the red dwarf Proxima Centauri at approximately 4.2 light - years ) , the Sun ranks fourth in mass . Orbit in Milky Way The Sun orbits the center of the Milky Way , and it is presently moving in the direction of the constellation of Cygnus .",

          "full_text": "In an approximation known as ideal magnetohydrodynamics , plasma particles only move along the magnetic field lines . As a result , the outward - flowing solar wind stretches the interplanetary magnetic field outward , forcing it into a roughly radial structure . For a simple dipolar solar magnetic field , with opposite hemispherical polarities on either side of the solar magnetic equator , a thin current sheet is formed in the solar wind . At great distances , the rotation of the Sun twists the dipolar magnetic field and corresponding current sheet into an Archimedean spiral structure called the Parker spiral . The interplanetary magnetic field is much stronger than the dipole component of the solar magnetic field . The Sun 's dipole magnetic field of 50 -- 400 \u03bcT ( at the photosphere ) reduces with the inverse - cube of the distance to about 0.1 nT at the distance of Earth . However , according to spacecraft observations the interplanetary field at Earth 's location is around 5 nT , about a hundred times greater . The difference is due to magnetic fields generated by electrical currents in the plasma surrounding the Sun . Variation in activity Measurements from 2005 of solar cycle variation during the last 30 years The Sun 's magnetic field leads to many effects that are collectively called solar activity . Solar flares and coronal - mass ejections tend to occur at sunspot groups . Slowly changing high - speed streams of solar wind are emitted from coronal holes at the photospheric surface . Both coronal - mass ejections and high - speed streams of solar wind carry plasma and interplanetary magnetic field outward into the Solar System . The effects of solar activity on Earth include auroras at moderate to high latitudes and the disruption of radio communications and electric power . Solar activity is thought to have played a large role in the formation and evolution of the Solar System . With solar - cycle modulation of sunspot number comes a corresponding modulation of space weather conditions , including those surrounding Earth where technological systems can be affected . Long - term change Long - term secular change in sunspot number is thought , by some scientists , to be correlated with long - term change in solar irradiance , which , in turn , might influence Earth 's long - term climate . For example , in the 17th century , the solar cycle appeared to have stopped entirely for several decades ; few sunspots were observed during a period known as the Maunder minimum . This coincided in time with the era of the Little Ice Age , when Europe experienced unusually cold temperatures . Earlier extended minima have been discovered through analysis of tree rings and appear to have coincided with lower - than - average global temperatures . A recent theory claims that there are magnetic instabilities in the core of the Sun that cause fluctuations with periods of either 41,000 or 100,000 years . These could provide a better explanation of the ice ages than the Milankovitch cycles . Life phases Main articles : Formation and evolution of the Solar System and Stellar evolution The Sun today is roughly halfway through the most stable part of its life . It has not changed dramatically for over four billion years , and will remain fairly stable for more than five billion more . However , after hydrogen fusion in its core has stopped , the Sun will undergo severe changes , both internally and externally . Formation The Sun formed about 4.6 billion years ago from the collapse of part of a giant molecular cloud that consisted mostly of hydrogen and helium and that probably gave birth to many other stars . This age is estimated using computer models of stellar evolution and through nucleocosmochronology . The result is consistent with the radiometric date of the oldest Solar System material , at 4.567 billion years ago . Studies of ancient meteorites reveal traces of stable daughter nuclei of short - lived isotopes , such as iron - 60 , that form only in exploding , short - lived stars . This indicates that one or more supernovae must have occurred near the location where the Sun formed . A shock wave from a nearby supernova would have triggered the formation of the Sun by compressing the matter within the molecular cloud and causing certain regions to collapse under their own gravity . As one fragment of the cloud collapsed it also began to rotate because of conservation of angular momentum and heat up with the increasing pressure .

At that time , Marston wanted to create his own new superhero ; Marston 's wife and fellow psychologist Elizabeth suggested to him that it should be a woman : William Moulton Marston , a psychologist already famous for inventing the polygraph , struck upon an idea for a new kind of superhero , one who would triumph not with fists or firepower , but with love . `` Fine , '' said Elizabeth . `` But make her a woman .

The character is a founding member of the Justice League , a goddess , and Ambassador - at - Large of the Amazon people . The character first appeared in All Star Comics # 8 in December 1941 and first cover - dated on Sensation Comics # 1 , January 1942 . In her homeland , the island nation of Themyscira , her official title is Princess Diana of Themyscira , Daughter of Hippolyta . When blending into the society outside of her homeland , she adopts her civilian identity Diana Prince . The character is also referred to by such epithets as the `` Amazing Amazon '' , the `` Spirit of Truth '' , `` Themyscira 's Champion '' , the `` God - Killer '' , and the `` Goddess of Love and War '' . Wonder Woman was created by the American psychologist and writer William Moulton Marston ( pen name : Charles Moulton ) , and artist Harry G. Peter . Marston 's wife , Elizabeth , and their lover , Olive Byrne , are credited as being his inspiration for the character 's appearance . Marston drew a great deal of inspiration from early feminists , and especially from birth control pioneer Margaret Sanger ; in particular , her piece `` Woman and the New Race '' . The Wonder Woman title has been published by DC Comics almost continuously except for a brief hiatus in 1986 . The world 's first and foremost female Super Hero , Wonder Woman at once embodies the unrivaled force and supreme grace of a born warrior , and the genuine compassion and understanding of a true humanitarian . As a symbol of equality , power , and truth , her natural confidence and unmistakable intelligence made her unequaled . Wonder Woman 's origin story relates that she was sculpted from clay by her mother Queen Hippolyta and given life by Aphrodite , along with superhuman powers as gifts by the Greek gods . In recent years , DC changed her background with the revelation that she is the daughter of Zeus and Hippolyta , jointly raised by her mother and her aunts Antiope and Menalippe . In the 1980s artist George Perez gave her a muscular look and emphasized her Amazonian heritage . Wonder Woman 's Amazonian training helped to develop a wide range of extraordinary skills in tactics , hunting , and combat . She possesses an arsenal of advanced technology , including the Lasso of Truth , a pair of indestructible bracelets , a tiara which serves as a projectile , and , in older stories , a range of devices based on Amazon technology . Wonder Woman 's character was created during World War II ; the character in the story was initially depicted fighting Axis military forces as well as an assortment of colorful supervillains , although over time her stories came to place greater emphasis on characters , deities , and monsters from Greek mythology . Many stories depicted Wonder Woman rescuing herself from bondage , which defeated the `` damsels in distress '' trope that was common in comics during the 1940s . In the decades since her debut , Wonder Woman has gained a cast of enemies bent on eliminating the Amazon , including classic villains such as Ares , Cheetah , Doctor Poison , Circe , Doctor Psycho , and Giganta , along with more recent adversaries such as Veronica Cale and the First Born .

          "full_text": "At that time , Marston wanted to create his own new superhero ; Marston 's wife and fellow psychologist Elizabeth suggested to him that it should be a woman : William Moulton Marston , a psychologist already famous for inventing the polygraph , struck upon an idea for a new kind of superhero , one who would triumph not with fists or firepower , but with love . `` Fine , '' said Elizabeth . `` But make her a woman . '' Marston introduced the idea to Gaines . Given the go - ahead , Marston developed Wonder Woman , whom he believed to be a model of that era 's unconventional , liberated woman . Marston also drew inspiration from the bracelets worn by Olive Byrne , who lived with the couple in a polyamorous relationship . Wonder Woman debuted in All Star Comics # 8 ( cover date Dec / Jan 1941 / 1942 , released in October 1941 ) , scripted by Marston . Marston was the creator of a systolic - blood - pressure - measuring apparatus , which was crucial to the development of the polygraph ( lie detector ) . Marston 's experience with polygraphs convinced him that women were more honest than men in certain situations and could work more efficiently . Marston designed Wonder Woman to be an allegory for the ideal love leader ; the kind of women who ( he believed ) should run society . `` Wonder Woman is psychological propaganda for the new type of woman who should , I believe , rule the world '' , Marston wrote . In a 1943 issue of The American Scholar , Marston wrote : Not even girls want to be girls so long as our feminine archetype lacks force , strength , and power . Not wanting to be girls , they do n't want to be tender , submissive , peace - loving as good women are . Women 's strong qualities have become despised because of their weakness . The obvious remedy is to create a feminine character with all the strength of Superman plus all the allure of a good and beautiful woman . Marston went on record by describing bondage and submission as a `` respectable and noble practice '' . Marston wrote in a weakness for Wonder Woman , which was attached to a fictional stipulation that he dubbed `` Aphrodite 's Law '' , that made the chaining of her `` Bracelets of Submission '' together by a man take away her Amazonian super strength . However , not everything about his creation was explicitly explained in any one source , which caused confusion among writers and fans for many years . Golden Age ( edit ) Main article : Golden Age of Comic Books Initially , Wonder Woman was an Amazon champion who wins the right to return Steve Trevor -- a United States intelligence officer whose plane had crashed on the Amazons ' isolated island homeland -- to `` Man 's World '' and to fight crime and the evil of the Nazis . During this period , Wonder Woman joined the Justice Society of America as the team 's secretary . Silver Age ( edit ) Main article : Silver Age of Comic Books During the Silver Age , under writer Robert Kanigher , Wonder Woman 's origin was revamped , along with other characters ' . The new origin story increased the character 's Hellenic and mythological roots : receiving the blessing of each deity in her crib , Diana is destined to become as `` beautiful as Aphrodite , wise as Athena , strong as Hercules , and swift as Hermes . '' At the end of the 1960s , under the guidance of Mike Sekowsky , Wonder Woman surrendered her powers in order to remain in Man 's World rather than accompany her fellow Amazons to another dimension . Wonder Woman begins using the alias Diana Prince and opens a mod boutique . She acquires a Chinese mentor named I Ching , who teaches Diana martial arts and weapons skills . Using her fighting skill instead of her powers , Diana engaged in adventures that encompassed a variety of genres , from espionage to mythology . This phase of her story was directly influenced by the British spy thriller The Avengers and Diana Rigg 's portrayal of Emma Peel . Bronze Age ( edit ) Main article : Bronze Age of Comic Books In the early 1970s the character returned to her superhero roots in the Justice League of America and to the World War II era in her own title . This however , was ultimately due to the popularity of the TV series at the time also having Wonder Woman set in WW2 era , and was shifted back to the 1970s era once the TV show did the same . With a new decade arriving , DC president Jenette Kahn ordered a revamp in Wonder Woman 's appearance . Artist Milton Glaser , who also designed the `` bullet '' logo adopted by DC in 1977 , created a stylized `` WW '' emblem that evoked and replaced the eagle in her bodice , and debuted in 1982 .",

With a major presence in Europe , due to the success of Toyota Team Europe , the corporation decided to set up Toyota Motor Europe Marketing and Engineering , TMME , to help market vehicles in the continent . Two years later , Toyota set up a base in the United Kingdom , TMUK , as the company 's cars had become very popular among British drivers . Bases in Indiana , Virginia , and Tianjin were also set up . In 1999 , the company decided to list itself on the New York and London Stock Exchanges . 2000s ( edit ) In 2001 , Toyota 's Toyo Trust and Banking merged with two other banks to form UFJ Bank , which was accused of corruption by Japan 's government for making bad loans to alleged Yakuza crime syndicates with executives accused of blocking Financial Service Agency inspections . The UFJ was listed among Fortune Magazine 's largest money - losing corporations in the world , with Toyota 's chairman serving as a director . At the time , the UFJ was one of the largest shareholders of Toyota . As a result of Japan 's banking crisis , UFJ merged with the Bank of Tokyo - Mitsubishi to become the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group . In 2002 , Toyota managed to enter a Formula One works team and establish joint ventures with French motoring companies Citro\u00ebn and Peugeot a year after Toyota started producing cars in France . Toyota ranked eighth on Forbes 2000 list of the world 's leading companies for the year 2005 but slid to 55 for 2011 . The company was number one in global automobile sales for the first quarter of 2008 . In 2007 , Toyota released an update of its full - sized truck , the Tundra , produced in two American factories , one in Texas and one in Indiana . Motor Trend named the Tundra `` Truck of the Year '' , and the 2007 Toyota Camry `` Car of the Year '' for 2007 . It also began the construction of two new factories , one to build the RAV4 in Woodstock , Ontario , Canada , and the other to build the Toyota Prius in Blue Springs , Mississippi , USA . This plant was originally intended to build the Toyota Highlander , but Toyota decided to use the plant in Princeton , Indiana , USA , instead . The company has also found recent success with its smaller models -- the Corolla and Yaris . 2010s ( edit ) In 2011 , Toyota , along with large parts of the Japanese automotive industry , suffered from a series of natural disasters . The 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami led to a severe disruption of the supplier base and a drop in production and exports . Severe flooding during the 2011 monsoon season in Thailand affected Japanese automakers that had chosen Thailand as a production base . Toyota is estimated to have lost production of 150,000 units to the tsunami and production of 240,000 units to the floods . On February 10 , 2014 , it was announced that Toyota would cease manufacturing vehicles and engines in Australia by the end of 2017 . The decision was based on the unfavourable Australian dollar making exports not viable , the high cost of local manufacture and the high amount of competition in a relatively small local market . The company plans to consolidate its corporate functions in Melbourne by the end of 2017 . The head office will remain in Port Melbourne and the Altona plant will be retained for other functions . The workforce is expected to be reduced from 3,900 to 1,300 . The automaker narrowly topped global sales for the first half of 2014 , selling 5.1 million vehicles in the six months ending June 30 , 2014 , an increase of 3.8 % on the same period the previous year . Volkswagen AG , which recorded sales of 5.07 million vehicles , was close behind . In August 2014 , Toyota announced it would be cutting its spare - parts prices in China by up to 35 % . The company admitted the move was in response to a probe foreshadowed earlier in the month by China 's National Development and Reform Commission of Toyota 's Lexus spare - parts policies , as part of an industry - wide investigation into what the Chinese regulator considers exorbitantly high prices being charged by automakers for spare parts and after - sales servicing . In November 2015 , the company announced that it would invest US $1 billion over the next 5 years into artificial intelligence and robotics research . In 2016 , Toyota invested in Uber .",

History ( edit ) Main article : History of Toyota 1930s ( edit ) In 1924 , Sakichi Toyoda invented the Toyoda Model G Automatic Loom . The principle of jidoka , which means the machine stops itself when a problem occurs , became later a part of the Toyota Production System . Looms were built on a small production line . In 1929 , the patent for the automatic loom was sold to the British company Platt Brothers , generating the starting capital for the automobile development . Mass production of Toyoda automated loom , displayed at the Toyota Museum in Nagakute - cho , Aichi - gun , Aichi Pref . Japan The production of Toyota automobiles was started in 1933 as a division of Toyoda Automatic Loom Works devoted to the production of automobiles under the direction of the founder 's son , Kiichiro Toyoda . Its first vehicles were the A1 passenger car and the G1 in 1935 . The Toyota Motor Co. was established as an independent company in 1937 Toyoda Standard Sedan AA 1936 Vehicles were originally sold under the name `` Toyoda '' ( \u30c8\u30e8\u30c0 ) , from the family name of the company 's founder , Kiichir\u014d Toyoda . In April 1936 , Toyoda 's first passenger car , the Model AA , was completed . The sales price was 3,350 yen , 400 yen cheaper than Ford or GM cars . House of Toyota founder Kiichiro Toyoda , near Toyota City In September 1936 , the company ran a public competition to design a new logo . Of 27,000 entries , the winning entry was the three Japanese katakana letters for `` Toyoda '' in a circle . But Rizaburo Toyoda , who had married into the family and was not born with that name , preferred `` Toyota '' ( \u30c8\u30e8\u30bf ) because it took eight brush strokes ( a lucky number ) to write in Japanese , was visually simpler ( leaving off the diacritic at the end ) , and with a voiceless consonant instead of a voiced one ( voiced consonants are considered to have a `` murky '' or `` muddy '' sound compared to voiceless consonants , which are `` clear '' ) . Inside the house of Toyota founder Kiichiro Toyoda , near Toyota City Since toyoda literally means `` fertile rice paddies '' , changing the name also prevented the company from being associated with old - fashioned farming .

First - generation Toyopet Crown Model RSD ( 1955 / 1 -- 1958 / 10 ) Toyota at the Rally Dakar , 1992 1940s -- 1950s ( edit ) From September 1947 , Toyota 's small - sized vehicles were sold under the name `` Toyopet '' ( \u30c8\u30e8\u30da\u30c3\u30c8 ) . The first vehicle sold under this name was the Toyopet SA , but it also included vehicles such as the Toyopet SB light truck , Toyopet Stout light truck , Toyopet Crown , Toyopet Master , and the Toyopet Corona . The word `` Toyopet ( Japanese article ) '' was a nickname given to the Toyota SA due to its small size , as the result of a naming contest the Toyota Company organized in 1947 . However , when Toyota eventually entered the American market in 1957 with the Crown , the name was not well received due to connotations of toys and pets . The name was soon dropped for the American market , but continued in other markets until the mid-1960s . 1960s -- 1970s ( edit ) By the early 1960s , the US had begun placing stiff import tariffs on certain vehicles . The so - called `` chicken tax '' of 1964 placed a 25 % tax on imported light trucks . In response to the tariff , Toyota , Nissan Motor Co. and Honda Motor Co. began building plants in the US by the early 1980s . 1980s ( edit ) With over 40 million sold , the Corolla is one of the most popular and best selling cars in the world . Toyota received its first Japanese Quality Control Award at the start of the 1980s and began participating in a wide variety of motorsports . Due to the 1973 oil crisis , consumers in the lucrative US market began turning to small cars with better fuel economy . American car manufacturers had considered small economy cars to be an entry - level product , and their small vehicles employed a low level of quality to keep the price low . Conservative Toyota held on to rear - wheel - drive designs for longer than most ; while a clear first in overall production they were only third in production of front - wheel - drive cars in 1983 , behind Nissan and Honda . In part due to this , Nissan 's Sunny managed to squeeze by the Corolla in numbers built that year . In 1982 , the Toyota Motor Company and Toyota Motor Sales merged into one company , the Toyota Motor Corporation . Two years later , Toyota entered into a joint venture with General Motors called the New United Motor Manufacturing , Inc , NUMMI , operating an automobile - manufacturing plant in Fremont , California . The factory was an old General Motors plant that had been closed for two years . Toyota then started to establish new brands at the end of the 1980s , with the launch of their luxury division Lexus in 1989 . 1990s ( edit ) In the 1990s , Toyota began to branch out from producing mostly compact cars by adding many larger and more luxurious vehicles to its lineup , including a full - sized pickup , the T100 ( and later the Tundra ) , several lines of SUVs , a sport version of the Camry , known as the Camry Solara , and the Scion brand .

Eren Jaeger , of the town called the Shiganshina District , wishes to see the outside world by joining the Scout Regiment , as he likens living in the cities to livestock . Despite this , his adopted sister Mikasa Ackermann and their mother Carla Jaeger are against him joining the Scouts . Even after seeing the Scouts return home with large casualties , Eren expresses his interest to join , which impresses his father Grisha Jaeger . After Eren and Mikasa rescue their friend Armin Arlelt from a group of delinquents due to his views that the walls will not protect them forever , the Colossal Titan suddenly appears and knocks down the gate to the Shiganshina District , which lies in the outer edge of Wall Maria , allowing smaller Titans to enter .

The two teams met in the playoffs for the first time on January 12 , 2014 , at Denver 's Sports Authority Field at Mile High , with the Broncos winning 24 -- 17 . Seattle Seahawks ( edit ) The Broncos had an old rivalry with the Seattle Seahawks , who were members of the AFC West from 1977 -- 2001 , prior to the Seahawks ' move to the NFC West as part of the NFL 's 2002 re-alignment . During the 25 years in which the Seahawks resided in the AFC West , the Broncos went 32 -- 18 against the Seahawks , including a loss at Seattle in the 1983 NFL playoffs . Since 2002 , the two teams have split four interconference meetings , and the two teams met in Super Bowl XLVIII on February 2 , 2014 , with the Seahawks winning by a score of 43 -- 8 . Historical ( edit ) Aside from the aforementioned AFC West teams , the Broncos have had intra-conference rivalries over the years with the Cleveland Browns , Pittsburgh Steelers and New England Patriots . Cleveland Browns ( edit ) See also : The Drive and The Fumble The Broncos had a brief rivalry with the Browns that arose from three AFC championship matches from 1986 -- 89 . In the 1986 AFC Championship , quarterback John Elway led The Drive to secure a tie in the waning moments at Cleveland Municipal Stadium ; the Broncos went on to win in 23 -- 20 in overtime . One year later , the two teams met again in the 1987 AFC Championship at Mile High Stadium . Denver took a 21 -- 3 lead , but Browns ' quarterback Bernie Kosar threw four touchdown passes to tie the game at 31 -- 31 halfway through the 4th quarter . After a long drive , John Elway threw a 20 - yard touchdown pass to running back Sammy Winder to give Denver a 38 -- 31 lead . Cleveland advanced to Denver 's 8 - yard line with 1 : 12 left , but Broncos ' safety Jeremiah Castille stripped Browns ' running back Earnest Byner of the football at the 2 - yard line -- a play that has been called The Fumble by Browns ' fans . The Broncos recovered it , gave Cleveland an intentional safety , and went on to win 38 -- 33 . The two teams met yet again in the 1989 AFC Championship at Mile High Stadium , which the Broncos easily won by a score of 37 -- 21 . Interestingly , the Broncos would not win the Super Bowl after any of the championship games where they beat the Browns . Pittsburgh Steelers ( edit ) As of the end of the 2015 season , the Broncos have met the Steelers in postseason play eight times , more than any other NFL team , with the Broncos owning a 5 -- 3 playoff record vs. the Steelers . Perhaps the most memorable postseason matchup occurred in the 1997 AFC Championship , in which the Broncos defeated the Steelers 24 -- 21 at Three Rivers Stadium , en route to their first Super Bowl victory . Eight years later , the Steelers returned the favor at INVESCO Field at Mile High , defeating the Broncos 34 -- 17 in the 2005 AFC Championship , and subsequently won Super Bowl XL . In the Wild Card round of the 2011 playoffs , the Broncos stunned the Steelers 29 -- 23 on the first play of overtime , when quarterback Tim Tebow connected with wide receiver Demaryius Thomas on an 80 - yard game - winning touchdown pass . The teams met again in the Divisional round of the 2015 playoffs at Denver , where the Broncos defeated the Steelers 23 -- 16 on their way to a victory in Super Bowl 50 . New England Patriots ( edit ) See also : Broncos -- Patriots rivalry and Tom Brady -- Peyton Manning rivalry The Broncos and Patriots met twice annually during the American Football League ( AFL ) years from 1960 -- 69 , and played in the first - ever AFL game on September 9 , 1960 . Since 1995 , the two teams have met frequently during the regular season , including nine consecutive seasons from 1995 -- 2003 . As of the end of the 2015 season , the two teams have met in the playoffs five times , with the Broncos owning a 4 -- 1 record .",

'' Other attacks against the Methodists were physically violent -- Wesley was nearly murdered by a mob at Wednesbury in 1743 . The Methodists responded vigorously to their critics and thrived despite the attacks against them . Separation from the Anglican Church ( edit ) See also : History of Methodism in the United States and John Wesley \u00a7 Persecutions and lay preaching The first Methodist chapel , `` The Foundery '' , London . Initially , the Methodists merely sought reform within the Church of England ( Anglicanism ) , but the movement gradually departed from that Church . George Whitefield 's preference for extemporaneous prayer rather than the fixed forms of prayer in the BCP , in addition to his insistence on the necessity of the New Birth , set him at odds with Anglican clergy . As Methodist societies multiplied , and elements of an ecclesiastical system were , one after another , adopted , the breach between John Wesley and the Church of England gradually widened . In 1784 , Wesley responded to the shortage of priests in the American colonies due to the American Revolutionary War by ordaining preachers for America with power to administer the sacraments . This was a major reason for Methodism 's final split from the Church of England after Wesley 's death . This split created a separate , eventually worldwide , group of church denominations . With regard to the position of Methodism within Christendom , `` John Wesley once noted that what God had achieved in the development of Methodism was no mere human endeavor but the work of God . As such it would be preserved by God so long as history remained . '' The influence of Whitefield and Lady Huntingdon on the Church of England was a factor in the founding of the Free Church of England in 1844 . At the time of Wesley 's death there were over 500 Methodist preachers in British colonies and the United States . Total membership of the Methodist societies in Britain was recorded as 56,000 in 1791 , rising to 360,000 in 1836 and 1,463,000 by the national census of 1851 . Early Methodism experienced a radical and spiritual phase that allowed women authority in church leadership . The role of the woman preacher emerged from the sense that the home should be a place of community care and should foster personal growth . Methodist women formed a community that cared for the vulnerable , extending the role of mothering beyond physical care . Women were encouraged to testify their faith . However the centrality of women 's role sharply diminished after 1790 as Methodist churches became more structured and more male dominated . The Wesleyan Education Committee , which existed from 1838 to 1902 , has documented the Methodist Church 's involvement in the education of children . At first most effort was placed in creating Sunday Schools but in 1836 the British Methodist Conference gave its blessing to the creation of `` Weekday schools '' . Methodism spread throughout the British Empire and , mostly through Whitefield 's preaching during what historians call the First Great Awakening , in colonial America . After Whitefield 's death in 1770 , however , American Methodism entered a more lasting Wesleyan and Arminian phase of development . Theology ( edit ) A traditional summary of Methodist teaching All need to be saved . All may be saved . All may know themselves saved . All may be saved to the uttermost . Catechism for the Use of the People Called Methodists . Methodist churches do not adhere to a single definitive statement or `` confession '' of belief , unlike the Westminster Confession used by Reformed churches or the Augsburg Confession used by Lutheran churches . Many Methodist bodies , such as the African Methodist Episcopal Church and the United Methodist Church , base their doctrinal standards on Wesley 's Articles of Religion , an abridgment of the Thirty - nine Articles of the Church of England that excised its Calvinist features . Some Methodist denominations also publish catechisms , which concisely summarise Christian doctrine . Methodists generally accept the Apostles ' Creed and the Nicene Creed as declarations of shared Christian faith . Methodism also affirms the traditional Christian belief in the triune Godhead : Father , Son and Holy Spirit , as well as the orthodox understanding of the consubstantial humanity and divinity of Jesus Christ . Methodism is evangelical in doctrine and is characterized by Wesleyan - Arminian theology . John Wesley is studied by Methodists for his interpretation of church practice and doctrine .",

The northern and southern branches were reunited in 1939 , when slavery was no longer an issue . In this merger also joined the Methodist Protestant Church . Some southerners , conservative in theology , opposed the merger , and formed the Southern Methodist Church in 1940 The Third Great Awakening from 1858 to 1908 saw enormous growth in Methodist membership , and a proliferation of institutions such as colleges ( e.g. , Morningside College ) . Methodists were often involved in the Missionary Awakening and the Social Gospel Movement . The awakening in so many cities in 1858 started the movement , but in the North it was interrupted by the Civil War . In the South , on the other hand , the Civil War stimulated revivals , especially in Lee 's army . In 1914 -- 1917 many Methodist ministers made strong pleas for world peace . President Woodrow Wilson ( a Presbyterian ) , promised `` a war to end all wars , '' using language of a future peace that had been a watchword for the postmillennial movement . In the 1930s many Methodists favored isolationist policies . Thus in 1936 , Methodist Bishop James Baker , of the San Francisco Conference , released a poll of ministers showing 56 % opposed warfare . However , the Methodist Federation did call for a boycott of Japan , which had invaded China and was disrupting missionary activity there . In Chicago , 62 local African Methodist Episcopal churches voted their support for the Roosevelt administration 's policy , while opposing any plan to send American troops overseas to fight . When war came in 1941 , the vast majority of Methodists strongly supported the national war effort , but there were also a few ( 673 ) conscientious objectors . The `` cross and flame '' logo of the United Methodist Church . The United Methodist Church ( UMC ) was formed in 1968 as a result of a merger between the Evangelical United Brethren Church ( EUB ) and The Methodist Church . The former church had resulted from mergers of several groups of German Methodist heritage , however there was no longer any need or desire to worship in the German language . The latter church was a result of union between the Methodist Protestant Church and the northern and southern factions of the Methodist Episcopal Church . The merged church had approximately nine million members as of the late 1990s . While United Methodist Church in America membership has been declining , associated groups in developing countries are growing rapidly . Prior to the merge that led to the formation of the United Methodist Church , the Evangelical Methodist Church entered into a schism with the Methodist Church , citing modernism in its parent body as the reason for the departure in 1946 . The United Methodist Glide Memorial Church has served as a counter-culture rallying point and has been identified as a liberal church . American Methodist churches are generally organized on a connectional model , related , but not identical to that used in Britain . Pastors are assigned to congregations by bishops , distinguishing it from presbyterian government . Methodist denominations typically give lay members representation at regional and national Conferences at which the business of the church is conducted , making it different from most episcopal government . This connectional organizational model differs further from the congregational model , for example of Baptist , and Congregationalist Churches , among others . In addition to the United Methodist Church , there are over 40 other denominations that descend from John Wesley 's Methodist movement . Some , such as the African Methodist Episcopal Church , the Free Methodists and the Wesleyan Church ( formerly Wesleyan Methodist ) , are explicitly Methodist . There are also independent Methodist churches , many of which are affiliated with the Association of Independent Methodists . Others do not call themselves Methodist , but grew out of the Methodist movement : for example , The Salvation Army and the Church of the Nazarene . Some of the charismatic or Pentecostal churches such as the Pentecostal Holiness Church and the Assemblies of God also have roots in or draw from Wesleyan thought . The Holiness Revival was primarily among people of Methodist persuasion , who felt that the church had once again become apathetic , losing the Wesleyan zeal . Some important events of this revival were the writings of Phoebe Palmer during the mid-1800s , the establishment of the first of many holiness camp meetings at Vineland , New Jersey in 1867 , and the founding of Asbury College , ( 1890 ) , and other similar institutions in the U.S. around the turn of the twentieth century .",

A second distinctive liturgical feature of Methodism is the use of Covenant services . Although practice varies between different national churches , most Methodist churches annually follow the call of John Wesley for a renewal of their covenant with God . It is common , at least in British Methodism , for each congregation to normally hold an annual Covenant Service on the first convenient Sunday of the year , and Wesley 's Covenant Prayer is still used , with minor modification , in the order of service : Christ has many services to be done . Some are easy , others are difficult . Some bring honour , others bring reproach . Some are suitable to our natural inclinations and temporal interests , others are contrary to both ... Yet the power to do all these things is given to us in Christ , who strengthens us . ... I am no longer my own but yours . Put me to what you will , rank me with whom you will ; put me to doing , put me to suffering ; let me be employed for you or laid aside for you , exalted for you or brought low for you ; let me be full , let me be empty , let me have all things , let me have nothing ; I freely and wholeheartedly yield all things to your pleasure and disposal . Lifestyle ( edit ) Early Methodists wore plain dress , with Methodist clergy condemning `` high headdresses , ruffles , laces , gold , and ' costly apparel ' in general '' . John Wesley recommended that Methodists annually read his thoughts On Dress ; in that sermon , John Wesley expressed his desire for Methodists : `` Let me see , before I die , a Methodist congregation , full as plain dressed as a Quaker congregation '' . The 1858 Discipline of the Wesleyan Methodist Connection thus stated that `` we would ... ejoin on all who fear God plain dress '' . Peter Cartwright , a Methodist revivalist , stated that in addition to wearing plain dress , the early Methodists distinguished themselves from other members of society by fasting once a week , abstaining from alcohol , and devoutly observing the Sabbath . The early Methodists did not participate in , and condemned , `` wordly habits '' including `` playing cards , racing horses , gambling , attending the theater , dancing ( both in frolics and balls ) , and cockfighting '' . Over time , many of these practices were gradually relaxed in mainline Methodism , although practices such teetotalism and fasting are still very much encouraged , in addition to the current prohibition of gambling ; denominations of the conservative holiness movement , such as the Bible Methodist Connection of Churches , continue to reflect the spirit of the historic Methodist practice of wearing plain dress , encouraging members in `` abstaining from the wearing of extravagant hairstyles , jewelry -- to include rings , and expensive clothing for any reason '' . The General Rules of the Methodist Church in America , which are among the doctrinal standards of many Methodist Churches , promote first - day Sabbatarianism as they require `` attending upon all the ordinances of God '' including `` the public worship of God '' and prohibit `` profaning the day of the Lord , either by doing ordinary work therein or by buying or selling '' .

Although Methodism is declining in Great Britain and North America , it is growing in other places ; at a rapid pace in , for example , South Korea . There is no single Methodist Church with universal juridical authority ; Methodists belong to multiple independent denominations or `` connexions '' . The great majority of Methodists are members of denominations which are part of the international World Methodist Council , an association of 80 Methodist , Wesleyan and related united and uniting churches , representing over 80 million people .

However , these `` seasons '' only correspond to story arcs ( which are themselves split at debatable points ) , and not to the pattern in which the show actually aired in either Japan or the United States . In Japan , Dragon Ball Z ( like both of the other Dragon Ball series ) was aired year - round continuously , with regular off - days for sporting events and television specials taking place about once every six weeks on average .

The Eagle has landed . '' Armstrong 's unrehearsed change of call sign from `` Eagle '' to `` Tranquility Base '' emphasized to listeners that landing was complete and successful . Duke mispronounced his reply as he expressed the relief at Mission Control : `` Roger , Twan -- Tranquility , we copy you on the ground . You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue . We 're breathing again . Thanks a lot . '' Two and a half hours after landing , before preparations began for the EVA , Aldrin radioed to Earth : This is the LM pilot . I 'd like to take this opportunity to ask every person listening in , whoever and wherever they may be , to pause for a moment and contemplate the events of the past few hours and to give thanks in his or her own way . He then took communion privately . At this time NASA was still fighting a lawsuit brought by atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair ( who had objected to the Apollo 8 crew reading from the Book of Genesis ) demanding that their astronauts refrain from broadcasting religious activities while in space . As such , Aldrin chose to refrain from directly mentioning taking communion on the Moon . Aldrin was an elder at the Webster Presbyterian Church , and his communion kit was prepared by the pastor of the church , the Rev. Dean Woodruff . Aldrin described communion on the Moon and the involvement of his church and pastor in the October 1970 edition of Guideposts magazine and in his book Return to Earth . Webster Presbyterian possesses the chalice used on the Moon and commemorates the event each year on the Sunday closest to July 20 . The schedule for the mission called for the astronauts to follow the landing with a five - hour sleep period as they had been awake since early morning . However , they elected to forgo the sleep period and begin the preparations for the EVA early , thinking that they would be unable to sleep . Lunar surface operations See also : First Moon walk A mounted slowscan TV camera showing Armstrong as he climbs down the ladder to surface A photograph of Armstrong near the LM , taken by Aldrin on the lunar surface . This is one of the only photographs of Armstrong on the lunar surface ; most of the time he had the camera . The astronauts planned placement of the Early Apollo Scientific Experiment Package ( EASEP ) and the U.S. flag by studying their landing site through Eagle 's twin triangular windows , which gave them a 60 \u00b0 field of view . Preparation required longer than the two hours scheduled . Armstrong initially had some difficulties squeezing through the hatch with his Portable Life Support System ( PLSS ) . According to veteran Moon - walker John Young , a redesign of the LM to incorporate a smaller hatch had not been followed by a redesign of the PLSS backpack , so some of the highest heart rates recorded from Apollo astronauts occurred during LM egress and ingress . Several books indicate early mission timelines had Buzz Aldrin rather than Neil Armstrong as the first man on the Moon . At 02 : 39 UTC on Monday July 21 , 1969 , Armstrong opened the hatch , and at 02 : 51 UTC began his descent to the lunar surface . The Remote Control Unit controls on his chest kept him from seeing his feet . Climbing down the nine - rung ladder , Armstrong pulled a D - ring to deploy the Modular Equipment Stowage Assembly ( MESA ) folded against Eagle 's side and activate the TV camera , and at 02 : 56 : 15 UTC he set his left foot on the surface . The first landing used slow - scan television incompatible with commercial TV , so it was displayed on a special monitor and a conventional TV camera viewed this monitor , significantly reducing the quality of the picture .

Despite some technical and weather difficulties , ghostly black and white images of the first lunar EVA were received and broadcast to at least 600 million people on Earth . Although copies of this video in broadcast format were saved and are widely available , recordings of the original slow scan source transmission from the lunar surface were accidentally destroyed during routine magnetic tape re-use at NASA . The plaque left on the ladder of Eagle While still on the ladder , Armstrong uncovered a plaque mounted on the LM descent stage bearing two drawings of Earth ( of the Western and Eastern Hemispheres ) , an inscription , and signatures of the astronauts and President Nixon . The inscription read : Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon , July 1969 A.D. We came in peace for all mankind . After describing the surface dust as `` very fine - grained '' and `` almost like a powder , '' six and a half hours after landing , Armstrong stepped off Eagle 's footpad and declared , `` That 's one small step for ( a ) man , one giant leap for mankind . '' Armstrong intended to say `` That 's one small step for a man '' , but the word `` a '' is not audible in the transmission , and thus was not initially reported by most observers of the live broadcast . When later asked about his quote , Armstrong said he believed he said `` for a man '' , and subsequent printed versions of the quote included the `` a '' in square brackets . One explanation for the absence may be that his accent caused him to slur the words `` for a '' together ; another is the intermittent nature of the audio and video links to Earth , partly because of storms near Parkes Observatory . More recent digital analysis of the tape claims to reveal the `` a '' may have been spoken but obscured by static . That 's one small step ... Problems playing this file ? See media help . About seven minutes after stepping onto the Moon 's surface , Armstrong collected a contingency soil sample using a sample bag on a stick . He then folded the bag and tucked it into a pocket on his right thigh . This was to guarantee there would be some lunar soil brought back in case an emergency required the astronauts to abandon the EVA and return to the LM . Twelve minutes after the contingency sample was collected , Aldrin joined Armstrong on the surface , and described the view with the simple phrase , `` Magnificent desolation . '' Buzz Aldrin poses on the Moon , allowing Neil Armstrong to photograph both of them using the visor 's reflection In addition to fulfilling President Kennedy 's mandate to land a man on the Moon before the end of the 1960s , Apollo 11 was an engineering test of the Apollo system ; therefore , Armstrong snapped photos of the LM so engineers would be able to judge its post-landing condition . He removed the TV camera from the MESA and made a panoramic sweep , then mounted it on a tripod 68 feet ( 21 m ) from the LM . The TV camera cable remained partly coiled and presented a tripping hazard throughout the EVA . Armstrong said that moving in the lunar gravity , one - sixth of Earth 's , was `` even perhaps easier than the simulations ... It 's absolutely no trouble to walk around . '' Aldrin joined him on the surface and tested methods for moving around , including two - footed kangaroo hops . The PLSS backpack created a tendency to tip backward , but neither astronaut had serious problems maintaining balance . Loping became the preferred method of movement . The astronauts reported that they needed to plan their movements six or seven steps ahead . The fine soil was quite slippery . Aldrin remarked that moving from sunlight into Eagle 's shadow produced no temperature change inside the suit , though the helmet was warmer in sunlight , so he felt cooler in shadow . The astronauts planted a specially designed U.S. flag on the lunar surface , in clear view of the TV camera .",

'' Upon hearing the first recorded vocals , Jones stated that it was exactly what he was looking for . The song begins with seven distinct synthesizer notes played on the Synclavier digital synthesizer , with Tom Bahler credited for the Synclavier performance on the song . The intro is taken note for note from a demo LP released the year before , called `` The Incredible Sounds of Synclavier II '' first published in 1981 by Denny Jaeger Creative Services , Inc and sold by New England Digital , makers of the Synclavier . Eddie Van Halen , lead guitarist of hard rock band Van Halen , was asked to add a guitar solo . When initially contacted by Jones , Van Halen thought he was receiving a prank call . Having established that the call was genuine , Van Halen borrowed an amplifier from guitarist Allan Holdsworth and recorded his guitar solo free of any charge . `` I did it as a favor '' , the musician later said . `` I was a complete fool , according to the rest of the band , our manager and everyone else . I was not used . I knew what I was doing -- I do n't do something unless I want to do it . '' Van Halen recorded his contribution following Jones and Jackson arriving at the guitarist 's house with a `` skeleton version '' of the song . Fellow guitarist Steve Lukather recalled , `` Initially , we rocked it out as Eddie had played a good solo -- but Quincy thought it was too tough . So I had to reduce the distorted guitar sound and that is what was released . '' The song was among the last four completed for Thriller ; the others were `` Human Nature '' , `` P.Y.T. ( Pretty Young Thing ) '' and `` The Lady in My Life '' . Right before Van Halen 's guitar solo begins , a noise is heard that sounds like somebody knocking at a door . It is reported that the knock was a person walking into Eddie 's recording studio . Another story has claimed that the sound was simply the musician knocking on his own guitar . The sound , however , is that of Jackson knocking on a drum case , as he is credited in the album 's liner notes . The engineers were shocked during the recording of Van Halen 's solo to discover that the sound of his guitar had caused the monitor speaker in the control room to catch fire , causing one to exclaim , `` This must be really good ! '' The lyrics of `` Beat It '' have been described as a `` sad commentary on human nature '' . The line `` do n't be a macho man '' is said to express Jackson 's dislike of violence , whilst also referring to the childhood abuse he faced at the hands of his father Joseph . The song is played in the key of E \u266d minor at a moderately fast tempo of 138 -- 139 beats per minute . In the song , Jackson 's vocal range is B3 to D5 . Drums on the song were played by Toto co-founder Jeff Porcaro . A remix of `` 2 Bad '' , is featured on Blood on the Dance Floor : HIStory in the Mix containing a sample of `` Beat It '' as well as a rap by John Fort\u00e9 and guitar solo by Wyclef Jean . Release and reception ( edit ) `` The uncredited guitarist who whipped out the fluttering , squealing solo on this ode to macho cowardice was Eddie Van Halen . The aerodynamic metal flight pumped crossover fuel that would boost the success of Thriller -- a gimmick Jackson would flog later with spots from Slash and Carlos Santana . Without the Van Halen precedent , there might have been no collaboration of Run - DMC and Aerosmith on the 1986 rap / rock version of ' Walk This Way ' . '' -- Greg Burk , South Coast Today . `` Beat It '' was released on February 14 , 1983 , following the successful chart performances of `` The Girl Is Mine '' and `` Billie Jean '' . Frank DiLeo , the vice president of Epic Records , convinced Jackson to release `` Beat It '' while `` Billie Jean '' was heading towards No. 1 . Dileo , who would later become the singer 's manager , predicted that both singles would remain in the Top 10 at the same time . `` Billie Jean '' remained atop the Billboard Hot 100 for seven weeks , before being toppled by `` Come On Eileen '' , which stayed at No. 1 for a single week , before Jackson reclaimed the position with `` Beat It '' .",

Release ( edit ) Wonder Woman had its world premiere on May 15 , 2017 in Shanghai . It premiered on May 25 , 2017 in Los Angeles . The film 's London premiere , which was scheduled to take place on May 31 at the Odeon Leicester Square , was cancelled due to the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing . The film had its Latin America premiere in Mexico City on May 27 . It was released in most of the world , including in IMAX , on June 2 , 2017 , after originally being scheduled for June 23 . Belgium , Singapore and South Korea received the film first , with May 31 openings . On April 17 , it was announced that Wonder Woman would be released in China on June 2 , the same day as its North American release . Marketing ( edit ) The success of the superhero television series Supergirl informed the marketing and promotion strategy used for Wonder Woman . According to Time Warner chief marketing officer Kristen O'Hara , they wanted to approach the Wonder Woman marketing campaign in a light manner , similar to how they did with Supergirl . O'Hara elaborated that the modest campaign route they took for Supergirl aided in establishing a large central fanbase among women well in advance of the series , which reportedly generated 5 million female superhero fans in one week . They were then able to model over time , and grow that audience leading up to the 15 - months - later release of Wonder Woman . Though neither the film nor the series are aimed exclusively at women , the latter 's campaign gave them their first opportunity to begin collecting data about female superhero fans . In May 2017 , a promo for Wonder Woman was released during the season finale of Supergirl , featuring a remix of the song `` These Boots Are Made for Walkin ' '' and Supergirl ( Melissa Benoist ) wearing Wonder Woman 's boots . The promo included an appearance by Lynda Carter , star of the 1970s Wonder Woman , who plays the American president on Supergirl . The costs for television advertisements for Wonder Woman are higher in comparison to that of previous DCEU film Suicide Squad . Warner Bros. has spent over $3 million on advertisements for Wonder Woman , whereas they spent $2.6 million on advertisements for Suicide Squad . Ticket selling site Fandango reported that Wonder Woman rounded the final leg of its marketing campaign as the most anticipated blockbuster of summer 2017 , according to a poll conducted by 10,000 voters , the biggest survey in company history . Separately , Fandango also found that 92 % of people surveyed said that they are looking forward to seeing a film that features a standalone woman superhero , and 87 % wished Hollywood would make more women - led superhero films . In May 2017 , NASCAR driver Danica Patrick drove her No. 10 car with a Wonder Woman paint scheme at the Go Bowling 400 in Kansas and at the Monster Energy Open in Charlotte . Home Media ( edit ) Wonder Woman was released on Digital HD on August 29 , 2017 and on Blu - ray , Blu - ray 3D , 4K Ultra-HD Blu - ray and DVD on September 19 , 2017 . The film debuted at the top spot of both the NPD VideoScan overall disc sales chart and the Blu - ray Disc sales chart .

The film debuted at the top spot of both the NPD VideoScan overall disc sales chart and the Blu - ray Disc sales chart . Controversies ( edit ) Bans ( edit ) On May 31 , Wonder Woman was banned in Lebanon after the Campaign to Boycott Supporters of Israel asked the Lebanese government 's Ministry of Economy and Trade to block the film because its star , Gal Gadot , is Israeli . The Lebanese government did not , however , ban Gadot 's Fast & Furious films which did screen in Lebanon . On June 7 , Variety reported that a Tunisian court suspended the theatrical release of Wonder Woman after a lawsuit brought by the Al - Chaab party and the Tunisian Association of Young Lawyers to have the film blocked due to Gadot 's Israeli citizenship , military service , and public comments in support of the Israeli military during the 2014 war in Gaza . Jordan was reportedly also considering a ban of the film and suspended screenings pending a decision , but on June 11 , Al Bawaba reported that the government decided not to do so , as there was no legal precedent for it . Women - only screenings ( edit ) Some men were unhappy with women - only screenings held at the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema in Austin , with some opponents of the gender - restricted screening stating on platforms such as Facebook that such screenings were discriminatory against men . An Albany Law School professor initiated a complaint with Austin 's Equal Employment and Fair Housing Office claiming discrimination against male prospective customers and employees of the theater . The chain responded with an online statement saying the event `` may have created confusion -- we want everybody to see this film '' and announced a similar event at their Brooklyn location . Tickets sold out in less than an hour , prompting the chain to schedule additional screenings . On July 18 , Alamo Drafthouse proposed settlement offers of a Wonder Woman DVD to the complainants , stating `` Respondent did not realize that advertising a ' women 's only ' screening was a violation of discrimination laws '' Reception ( edit ) Box Office ( edit ) Wonder Woman grossed $412.6 million in the United States and Canada and $409.3 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $821.9 million , against a production budget of $149 million . Estimates for the number the film needed to surpass internationally in order to cover its production and promotional costs and break even ranged from $300 million to $460 million . North America ( edit ) In May 2017 , early tracking had Wonder Woman opening with $65 -- 75 million , and possibly as high as $105 million . The film opened Friday , June 2 , 2017 , across 4,165 theaters and made $38.7 million on its opening day , including $3.7 million in IMAX . It was the biggest single - day gross for a woman - directed film , ahead of the $35.9 million opening Friday of Catherine Hardwicke 's Twilight in 2008 and the biggest opening day for a woman - led comic book superhero film , ahead of Ghost in the Shell ( $7 million ) .
