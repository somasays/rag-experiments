And under the Hongwu Emperor 's feudal policies it was given to Zhu Di , one of his sons , who was created `` Prince of Yan '' . The early death of Zhu Yuanzhang 's heir led to a succession struggle on his death , one that ended with the victory of Zhu Di and the declaration of the new Yongle era . Since his harsh treatment of the Ming capital Yingtian ( modern Nanjing ) alienated many there , he established his fief as a new co-capital . The city of Beiping became Beijing ( northern capital ) or Shuntian in 1403 . The construction of the new imperial residence , the Forbidden City , took from 1406 to 1420 ; this period was also responsible for several other of the modern city 's major attractions , such as the Temple of Heaven and Tian'anmen . On 28 October 1420 , the city was officially designated the capital of the Ming dynasty in the same year that the Forbidden City was completed . Beijing became the empire 's primary capital and Yingtian , also called Nanjing ( southern capital ) , became the co-capital . ( A 1425 order by Zhu Di 's son , the Hongxi Emperor , to return the primary capital to Nanjing was never carried out : he died , probably of a heart attack , the next month . He was buried , like almost every Ming emperor to follow him , in an elaborate necropolis to Beijing 's north . ) By the 15th century , Beijing had essentially taken its current shape . The Ming city wall continued to serve until modern times , when it was pulled down and the 2nd Ring Road was built in its place . It is generally believed that Beijing was the largest city in the world for most of the 15th , 16th , 17th , and 18th centuries . The first known church was constructed by Catholics in 1652 at the former site of Matteo Ricci 's chapel ; the modern Nantang Cathedral was later built upon the same site . The capture of Beijing by Li Zicheng 's peasant army in 1644 ended the dynasty , but he and his Shun court abandoned the city without a fight when the Manchu army of Prince Dorgon arrived 40 days later . Qing dynasty Summer Palace is one of the several palatial gardens built by Qing emperors in the northwest suburb area Chongwenmen , a gate to the inner walled city , c. 1906 Dorgon established the Qing dynasty as a direct successor of the Ming ( delegitimising Li Zicheng and his followers ) and Beijing became China 's sole capital .

The sale price of single family homes in Hawaii was the highest of any U.S. city in 2010 , just above that of the Silicon Valley area of California ( US $602,000 ) . Hawaii 's very high cost of living is the result of several interwoven factors of the global economy in addition to domestic U.S. government trade policy . Like other regions with desirable weather throughout the year , such as areas of California , Arizona and Florida , Hawaii 's residents can be considered to be subject to a `` Sunshine tax '' . This situation is further exacerbated by the natural factors of geography and world distribution that lead to higher prices for goods due to increased shipping costs , a problem which many island states and territories suffer from as well . The situation is compounded even further by what could possibly be the single largest contributor to the high costs of living in Hawaii , a U.S. trade law known as the Jones Act , or the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 . This trade regulation prohibits any foreign - flagged ships from carrying cargo between two American ports -- a practice known as cabotage . Most consumer goods in the United States are manufactured by outsourced labor in East Asia , then transported by container ships to ports on the U.S. mainland , and Hawaii also receives the same goods . Being located in the central Pacific Ocean , right between major Pacific shipping lanes , it would be very economical to unload Hawaiian - bound goods in Honolulu , before continuing on to the mainland . However , this would effectively make the second leg of the voyage between Hawaii and the mainland a domestic route between two American ports . Because most large cargo ships operate under foreign `` flags of convenience '' such as Liberia , Vanuatu or Papua New Guinea , allowing them to avoid the more stringent , and thus more costly , regulations of developed nations ' ports , the domestic leg of the voyage would be disallowed by the Jones Act . Instead , those cargo ships must proceed directly to the West Coast , where distributors break bulk and transport the Hawaiian - bound , Asian - manufactured goods back across the ocean by U.S. - flagged ships and increasing the length of the voyage by more than 50 % . This highly inefficient system of shipping Hawaii 's consumer cargo comes at a very hefty price for the average Hawaiian citizen , and makes the cost of living in Hawaii much , much higher than it would otherwise be . Hawaiian consumers ultimately bear the expense of transporting goods imposed by the Jones Act . This law makes Hawaii less competitive than West Coast ports as a shopping destination for tourists from countries with much higher taxes like Japan , even though prices for Asian - manufactured goods should be cheaper because Hawaii is much closer than mainland states to Asia . Culture Main article : Culture of the Native Hawaiians The aboriginal culture of Hawaii is Polynesian . Hawaii represents the northernmost extension of the vast Polynesian Triangle of the south and central Pacific Ocean . While traditional Hawaiian culture remains as vestiges in modern Hawaiian society , there are re-enactments of the ceremonies and traditions throughout the islands . ",

The Newlands Resolution was passed by the House on June 15 , 1898 , by 209 votes in favor to 91 against , and by the Senate on July 6 , 1898 , by a vote of 42 to 21 . In 1900 , Hawaii was granted self - governance and retained \u02bbIolani Palace as the territorial capitol building . Despite several attempts to become a state , Hawaii remained a territory for 60 years . Plantation owners and capitalists , who maintained control through financial institutions such as the Big Five , found territorial status convenient because they remained able to import cheap , foreign labor . Such immigration and labor practices were prohibited in many states . The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 was the primary event that galvanized the United States into entering World War II . Puerto Rican immigration to Hawaii began in 1899 , when Puerto Rico 's sugar industry was devastated by two hurricanes , causing a worldwide shortage of sugar and a huge demand for sugar from Hawaii . Hawaiian sugarcane plantation owners began to recruit experienced , unemployed laborers in Puerto Rico . Two waves of Korean immigration to Hawaii occurred in the 20th century . The first wave arrived between 1903 and 1924 ; the second wave began in 1965 after President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 , which removed racial and national barriers and resulted in significantly altering the demographic mix in the U.S. O\u02bbahu was the target of a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor by Imperial Japan on December 7 , 1941 .

How would you know if he was going to be the warrior that would protect you at all costs , if he was n't your lover ? '' A 2012 poll by Gallup found that Hawaii had the largest proportion of lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ( LGBT ) adults in the U.S. , at 5.1 % , comprising an estimated adult LGBT population of 53,966 individuals . The number of same - sex couple households in 2010 was 3,239 ; a 35.5 % increase of figures from a decade earlier . In 2013 , Hawaii became the fifteenth U.S. state to legalize same - sex marriage ; a University of Hawaii researcher said the law may boost tourism by $217 million . Economy See also : Hawaii locations by per capita income Post-annexation , Hawaii 's economy and demographic changes were shaped mostly by the agricultural sector 's growth . From the end of World War II onwards , depictions and photographs , such as this , of Hawaii as a tropical , leisure paradise encouraged the growth of tourism in Hawaii , which eventually became the largest industry of the islands . The U.S. federal government 's spending on Hawaii - stationed personnel , installations and materiel , either directly or through military personnel spending , amounts to Hawaii 's second largest source of income , after tourism . The history of Hawaii 's economy can be traced through a succession of dominant industries ; sandalwood , whaling , sugarcane , pineapple , the military , tourism and education . Since statehood in 1959 , tourism has been the largest industry , contributing 24.3 % of the gross state product ( GSP ) in 1997 , despite efforts to diversify . The state 's gross output for 2003 was US $47 billion ; per capita income for Hawaii residents in 2014 was US $54,516 . Hawaiian exports include food and clothing . These industries play a small role in the Hawaiian economy , due to the shipping distance to viable markets , such as the West Coast of the contiguous U.S. The state 's food exports include coffee , macadamia nuts , pineapple , livestock , sugarcane and honey . By weight , honey bees may be the state 's most valuable export . According to the Hawaii Agricultural Statistics Service , agricultural sales were US $370.9 million from diversified agriculture , US $100.6 million from pineapple , and US $64.3 million from sugarcane . Hawaii 's relatively consistent climate has attracted the seed industry , which is able to test three generations of crops per year on the islands , compared with one or two on the mainland . Seeds yielded US $264 million in 2012 , supporting 1,400 workers . As of December 2015 , the state 's unemployment rate was 3.2 % . In 2009 , the United States military spent US $12.2 billion in Hawaii , accounting for 18 % of spending in the state for that year . 75,000 United States Department of Defense personnel live in Hawaii . According to a 2013 study by Phoenix Marketing International , Hawaii had the fourth - largest number of millionaires per capita in the United States , with a ratio of 7.2 % . Taxation Hawaii residents pay the most per person in state taxes in the United States . Millions of tourists pay general excise tax and hotel room tax . The Hawaii Tax Foundation considers the state 's tax burden too high , which it says contributes to higher prices and the perception of an unfriendly business climate . State Senator Sam Slom says state taxes are comparatively higher than other states because the state government handles education , health care , and social services that are usually handled at a county or municipal level in most other states . Cost of living The cost of living in Hawaii , specifically Honolulu , is high compared to that of most major U.S. cities , although it is 6.7 % lower than in New York City and 3.6 % lower than in San Francisco . These numbers may not take into account some costs , such as increased travel costs for flights , additional shipping fees , and the loss of promotional participation opportunities for customers outside the contiguous U.S. ",

For the later seasons , its creators see Game of Thrones as an adaptation of A Song of Ice and Fire as a whole rather than the individual novels ; this enables them to move events across novels , according to screen - adaptation requirements . Filming The Azure Window at Ras - id - Dwerja , on Gozo , was the site of the Dothraki wedding in season one . Principal photography for the first season was scheduled to begin on July 26 , 2010 , and the primary location was the Paint Hall Studios in Belfast , Northern Ireland . Exterior scenes in Northern Ireland were filmed at Sandy Brae in the Mourne Mountains ( standing in for Vaes Dothrak ) , Castle Ward ( Winterfell ) , Saintfield Estates ( the Winterfell godswood ) , Tollymore Forest ( outdoor scenes ) , Cairncastle ( the execution site ) , the Magheramorne quarry ( Castle Black ) and Shane 's Castle ( the tourney grounds ) . Doune Castle in Stirling , Scotland , was also used in the original pilot episode for scenes at Winterfell . The producers initially considered filming the whole series in Scotland , but decided on Northern Ireland because of the availability of studio space . The first season 's southern scenes were filmed in Malta , a change in location from the pilot episode 's Moroccan sets . The city of Mdina was used for King 's Landing . Filming was also done at Fort Manoel ( representing the Sept of Baelor ) , at the Azure Window on the island of Gozo ( the Dothraki wedding site ) and at San Anton Palace , Fort Ricasoli , Fort St. Angelo and St. Dominic monastery ( all used for scenes in the Red Keep ) . The walled city of Dubrovnik became King 's Landing in season two . Filming of the second season 's southern scenes shifted from Malta to Croatia , where the city of Dubrovnik and nearby locations allowed exterior shots of a walled , coastal medieval city . The Walls of Dubrovnik and Fort Lovrijenac were used for scenes in King 's Landing and the Red Keep . The island of Lokrum , the St. Dominic monastery in the coastal town of Trogir , the Rector 's Palace in Dubrovnik , and the Dubac quarry ( a few kilometers east ) were used for scenes set in Qarth . Scenes set north of the Wall , in the Frostfangs and at the Fist of the First Men , were filmed in November 2011 in Iceland : on the Vatnaj\u00f6kull glacier near Smyrlabj\u00f6rg , the Sv\u00ednafellsj\u00f6kull glacier near Skaftafell and the M\u00fdrdalsj\u00f6kull glacier near Vik on H\u00f6f\u00f0abrekkuhei\u00f0i . Third - season production returned to Dubrovnik , with the Walls of Dubrovnik , Fort Lovrijenac and nearby locations again used for scenes in King 's Landing and the Red Keep . Trsteno Arboretum , a new location , is the garden of the Tyrells in King 's Landing . The third season also returned to Morocco ( including the city of Essaouira ) to film Daenerys ' scenes in Essos . Dimmuborgir and the Grj\u00f3tagj\u00e1 cave in Iceland were used as well . One scene , with a live bear , was filmed in Los Angeles . The production used three units ( Dragon , Wolf and Raven ) filming in parallel , six directing teams , 257 cast members and 703 crew members . Ballintoy Harbour was Lordsport on the Iron Islands . The fourth season returned to Dubrovnik and included new locations , including Diocletian 's Palace in Split , Klis Fortress north of Split , Perun quarry east of Split , the Mosor mountain range , and Ba\u0161ka Voda further south . Thingvellir National Park in Iceland was used for the fight between Brienne and the Hound . Filming took 136 days and ended on November 21 , 2013 . The fifth season added Seville , Spain , used for scenes of Dorne , as well as C\u00f3rdoba .

They were trained by their anthropomorphic rat sensei in the art of ninjutsu . From their home in the sewers of New York City , they battle petty criminals , evil overlords , mutated creatures , and alien invaders while attempting to remain hidden from society . They were created by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird . The characters originated in comic books published by Mirage Studios and expanded into cartoon series , films , video games , toys , and other merchandise .

( April 2015 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) Cover of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles # 1 ( May 1984 ) The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles first appeared in an American comic book published by Mirage Studios in 1984 in Dover , New Hampshire . The concept arose from a humorous drawing sketched out by Eastman during a casual evening of brainstorming and bad television with Laird . Using money from a tax refund , together with a loan from Eastman 's uncle , the young artists self - published a single - issue comic intended to parody four of the most popular comics of the early 1980s : Marvel Comics ' Daredevil and New Mutants , Dave Sim 's Cerebus , and Frank Miller 's Ronin . The TMNT comic book series has been published in various incarnations by various comic book companies since 1984 . The Turtles started their rise to mainstream success when a licensing agent , Mark Freedman , sought out Eastman and Laird to propose wider merchandising opportunities for the franchise . In 1986 , Dark Horse Miniatures produced a set of 15 - mm ( approximately 0.6 inch ) lead figurines . In January 1987 , Eastman and Laird visited the offices of Playmates Toys , a small California toy company that wanted to expand into the action - figure market . Development was undertaken by a creative team of companies and individuals : Jerry Sachs , advertising agent of Sachs - Finley Agency , brought together the animators at Murakami - Wolf - Swenson headed by Fred Wolf .

It is considered by some to be the `` Great American Novel '' . The 50th anniversary of the novel 's release was met with celebrations and reflections on its impact .

It debuted in 1990 in Monroeville , a town that labels itself `` The Literary Capital of Alabama '' . The play runs every May on the county courthouse grounds and townspeople make up the cast . White male audience members are chosen at the intermission to make up the jury . During the courtroom scene the production moves into the Monroe County Courthouse and the audience is racially segregated . Author Albert Murray said of the relationship of the town to the novel ( and the annual performance ) : `` It becomes part of the town ritual , like the religious underpinning of Mardi Gras . With the whole town crowded around the actual courthouse , it 's part of a central , civic education -- what Monroeville aspires to be . '' Sergel 's play toured in the UK starting at West Yorkshire Playhouse in Leeds in 2006 , and again in 2011 starting at the York Theatre Royal , both productions featuring Duncan Preston as Atticus Finch . The play also opened the 2013 season at Regent 's Park Open Air Theatre in London where it played to full houses and starred Robert Sean Leonard as Atticus Finch , his first London appearance in 22 years . The production returned to the venue to close the 2014 season , prior to a UK tour . According to a National Geographic article , the novel is so revered in Monroeville that people quote lines from it like Scripture ; yet Harper Lee herself refused to attend any performances , because `` she abhors anything that trades on the book 's fame '' . To underscore this sentiment , Lee demanded that a book of recipes named Calpurnia 's Cookbook not be published and sold out of the Monroe County Heritage Museum . David Lister in The Independent states that Lee 's refusal to speak to reporters made them desire to interview her all the more , and her silence `` makes Bob Dylan look like a media tart '' . Despite her discouragement , a rising number of tourists made Monroeville their destination , hoping to see Lee 's inspiration for the book , or Lee herself . Local residents call them `` Mockingbird groupies '' , and although Lee was not reclusive , she refused publicity and interviews with an emphatic `` Hell , no ! '' Go set a Watchman Main article : Go Set a Watchman An earlier draft of To Kill a Mockingbird , titled Go Set a Watchman , was controversially released on July 14 , 2015 . This draft , which was completed in 1957 , is set 20 years after the time period depicted in To Kill a Mockingbird but is not a continuation of the narrative . This earlier version of the story follows an adult Scout Finch who travels from New York City to visit her father , Atticus Finch , in Maycomb , Alabama , where she is confronted by the intolerance in her community . The Watchman manuscript was believed to have been lost until Lee 's lawyer Tonja Carter discovered it , but this claim has been widely disputed . Watchman contains early versions of many of the characters from To Kill a Mockingbird . According to Lee 's agent Andrew Nurnberg , Mockingbird was originally intended to be the first book of a trilogy : `` They discussed publishing Mockingbird first , Watchman last , and a shorter connecting novel between the two . '' This assertion has been discredited , however , by rare - books expert James S. Jaffe , who reviewed the pages at the request of Lee 's attorney and found them to be only another draft of To Kill a Mockingbird . Nurnberg 's statement was also contrary to Jonathan Mahler 's description of how Watchman was seen as just the first draft of Mockingbird . Instances where many passages overlap between the two books , in some case word for word , also refutes this assertion . See also Southern literature Timeline of the African American Civil Rights Movement To Kill a Mockingbird in popular culture Notes Jump up ^ To Kill a Mockingbird has appeared on numerous other lists that describe its impact . In 1999 , it was voted the `` Best Novel of the 20th century '' by readers of the Library Journal . It is listed as number five on the Modern Library 's Reader 's List of the 100 Best Novels in the English language since 1900 and number four on the rival Radcliffe Publishing Course 's Radcliffe Publishing Course 's 100 Best Board Picks for Novels and Nonfiction Archived 2007 - 09 - 20 at the Wayback Machine ...

Another criticism , articulated by Michael Lind , is that the novel indulges in classist stereotyping and demonization of poor rural `` white trash '' . The novel is cited as a factor in the success of the civil rights movement in the 1960s , however , in that it `` arrived at the right moment to help the South and the nation grapple with the racial tensions ( of ) the accelerating civil rights movement '' . Its publication is so closely associated with the Civil Rights Movement that many studies of the book and biographies of Harper Lee include descriptions of important moments in the movement , despite the fact that she had no direct involvement in any of them . Civil Rights leader Andrew Young comments that part of the book 's effectiveness is that it `` inspires hope in the midst of chaos and confusion '' and by using racial epithets portrays the reality of the times in which it was set .

She is dressed , unmistakably , as a child . And , because she is sex columnist on a newspaper , a bus wearing a huge photo of her in a tiny dress trundles past . ' Carrie Bradshaw knows good sex , ' says the bus . And there , before any dialogue hits your ears , you have the two woeful female archetypes that Sex and the City loves -- woman as sex object and woman as child ... In another ( episode ) , Carrie realizes she is homeless because she has spent $40,000 on shoes and does not have a deposit for an apartment . ( In this crisis , she cries and borrows the money for the deposit -- what child would do anything else ? ) . '' Joan Swirsky , a New York -- based journalist and author , wrote in 2003 : `` Another example that feminism is dead is the popularity of Sex and the City , the HBO show that features 30 - and 40 - something women sending out the unmistakable messages to females both younger and older that careers , money , looks and , ostensibly , intelligence are nothing compared to doing anything to get a man , including endlessly obsessing about the subject , engaging in loveless or even like-less sexual encounters . '' Academic critics of the series , however , disagree on whether Sex and the City was truly anti-feminist , feminist , or post-feminist . Some argue whatever label is applied to the show , it offered an important contribution `` to ongoing dialogue '' and that because it `` shows women in a world where they can be feminine , attractive , and feminist at the same time ... the series gives a forum to a renewed postfeminist debate . '' In retrospective analysis of the show , critics have generally reassessed Carrie Bradshaw as an unsympathetic protagonist , despite the show 's portrayal of her as a positive figure . In 2013 , Glamour magazine called Carrie `` the worst '' character on the show , saying that `` her brattiness and self - absorption eclipsed her redeeming qualities and even her awesome shoes . '' In a 2010 retrospective about the previous two decades in pop culture , ABC News named Carrie one of the ten worst characters of the past twenty years , calling her a `` snippy , self - righteous Manhattan snob '' and citing the character 's actions in Sex and the City 2 as evidence that she was beyond personal growth or redemption . Emily Nussbaum of The New Yorker , looking back on the show a decade after it went off the air , argued Bradshaw was `` the unacknowledged first female anti-hero on television , '' who began as a `` happy , curious explorer , out companionably smoking with modellizers ( sic ) , '' but from the second season on she `` spun out , becoming anxious , obsessive , and , despite her charm , wildly self - centered . '' Nussbaum also asserted that it is only over time that the show 's reputation has `` shrunk and faded , '' largely due to disappointment that the show `` gave in '' to the limits of romantic comedy toward the end of the series . Until then , Nussbaum writes , Sex and the City `` was sharp , iconoclastic television . '' In answer to the question of why the show is now `` so often portrayed as a set of empty , static cartoons , an embarrassment to womankind , '' Nussbaum wrote : `` It 's a classic misunderstanding , I think , stemming from an unexamined hierarchy : the assumption that anything stylized ( or formulaic , or pleasurable , or funny , or feminine , or explicit about sex rather than about violence , or made collaboratively ) must be inferior . '' Nussbaum also pushed against criticism of Sex and the City as anti-feminist , arguing for a more complex view of the characters as situated within different waves of feminism : `` Miranda and Carrie were second - wave feminists , who believed in egalitarianism ; Charlotte and Samantha were third - wave feminists , focused on exploiting the power of femininity , from opposing angles . '' Broadcast and distribution ( edit ) Season one of Sex and the City aired on HBO from June to August 1998 . Season two was broadcast from June until October , 1999 . Season three aired from June until October 2000 . Season four was broadcast in two parts : from June until August 2001 , and then in January and February 2002 .

The battles were fought on April 19 , 1775 in Middlesex County , Province of Massachusetts Bay , within the towns of Lexington , Concord , Lincoln , Menotomy ( present - day Arlington ) , and Cambridge . They marked the outbreak of armed conflict between the Kingdom of Great Britain and its thirteen colonies in America . In late 1774 , Colonial leaders adopted the Suffolk Resolves in resistance to the alterations made to the Massachusetts colonial government by the British parliament following the Boston Tea Party . The colonial assembly responded by forming a Patriot provisional government known as the Massachusetts Provincial Congress and calling for local militias to train for possible hostilities . The Colonial government exercised effective control of the colony outside of British - controlled Boston . In response , the British government in February 1775 declared Massachusetts to be in a state of rebellion . About 700 British Army regulars in Boston , under Lieutenant Colonel Francis Smith , were given secret orders to capture and destroy Colonial military supplies reportedly stored by the Massachusetts militia at Concord . Through effective intelligence gathering , Patriot leaders had received word weeks before the expedition that their supplies might be at risk and had moved most of them to other locations . On the night before the battle , warning of the British expedition had been rapidly sent from Boston to militias in the area by several riders , including Paul Revere , with information about British plans . The initial mode of the Army 's arrival by water was signaled from the Old North Church in Boston to Charleston using lanterns to communicate `` one if by land , two if by sea '' . The first shots were fired just as the sun was rising at Lexington . Eight militiamen were killed , including Ensign Robert Munroe , their ranking officer . The British suffered only one casualty . The militia were outnumbered and fell back , and the regulars proceeded on to Concord , where they broke apart into companies to search for the supplies . At the North Bridge in Concord , approximately 400 militiamen engaged 100 regulars from three companies of the King 's troops at about 11 : 00 am , resulting in casualties on both sides . The outnumbered regulars fell back from the bridge and rejoined the main body of British forces in Concord . The British forces began their return march to Boston after completing their search for military supplies , and more militiamen continued to arrive from neighboring towns . Gunfire erupted again between the two sides and continued throughout the day as the regulars marched back towards Boston . Upon returning to Lexington , Lt. Col. ",

The word `` ceramics '' comes from the Greek keramikos ( \u03ba\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 ) , meaning `` pottery '' , which in turn comes from keramos ( \u03ba\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 ) meaning `` potter 's clay '' . Most traditional ceramic products were made from clay ( or clay mixed with other materials ) , shaped and subjected to heat , and tableware and decorative ceramics are generally still made this way .

Surreal Benson & Hedges poster at Victoria Station , London , c. 1978 The first calls to restrict advertising came in 1962 from the Royal College of Physicians , who highlighted the health problems and recommended stricter laws on the sale and advertising of tobacco products . In 1971 , an agreement between the government and the tobacco industry saw the inclusion of health warnings on all cigarette packets . All television commercials for cigarettes were banned on 1 August 1965 , although commercials for loose tobacco and cigars continued until 1991 . Non-television advertising campaigns were still allowed in the UK but came under stricter guidelines in 1986 , which in particular , prevented adverts from actually showing a person smoking . The tobacco producers responded with increasingly indirect and abstract campaigns , among which those of Benson & Hedges and Silk Cut became particularly recognisable . Until about the mid-1990s , many corner shops , newsagents and off licences had on their shop signs prominent branding by cigarette brands such as Benson & Hedges , Silk Cut , Regal etc. until the practice was outlawed . As part of their 1997 general election campaign , the Labour Party led by Tony Blair pledged to ban all advertising of tobacco products . When it was not included in their manifesto , it was introduced by Liberal Democrat Peer Tim Clement - Jones and was passed as the Tobacco Advertising and Promotion Act 2002 , which banned most remaining forms of advertising according to the following timescale : Date What was banned 14 February 2003 General advertising 14 May 2003 Promotions 30 July 2003 Sponsorship of sporting events within the UK May 2004 Particular advertisements in tobacconists 21 December 2004 Large adverts in shops , pubs and clubs 31 July 2005 Sponsorship of excepted global events ; brandsharing It was banned in Scotland by the Scottish Executive in 2001 . Several exemptions from this legislation remain : Advertisements that appear within the tobacco industry Advertisements in publications that are not primarily aimed at a British audience Advertisements in pubs , clubs and shops , as long as the advert 's total size does not exceed that of an A5 piece of paper , with 30 % of that being taken up by government health warnings . Advertisements other than those for cigarettes or hand - rolling tobacco within specialist tobacconists if the sale of cigars , snuff , pipe tobacco and smoking accessories accounts for over 50 % of their sales Direct mail that has been specifically requested While cigarette vending machines were still allowed in licensed premises ( until 1 October 2011 in England , 1 February 2012 in Wales , 1 March 2012 in Northern Ireland and 29 April 2013 in Scotland when a full ban came into force ) they were only allowed to display a picture of what was available ( one image per brand ) and no advertisements could be included on the machine . Finally , cigarette vending machines were then banned in public areas of all British pubs , clubs and restaurants , with a fine of \u00a3 2,500 for non-compliance . Famous UK tobacco advertising campaigns have included `` You 're never alone with a Strand '' ( a disastrous campaign which led to Strand Cigarettes being taken off the market ) and `` Happiness is a cigar called Hamlet '' . Italy ( edit ) In Italy , advertising of tobacco products has been banned since 1962 , though ad in magazines remained legal since the late - 1970s ; with a few subsequent changes to the law in 1983 and 2004 .

The law also prevents celebrities from endorsing tobacco products in advertising ; prior to the R.A. 9211 , actors Richard Gomez and the late Rudy Fernandez had promoted a cigarette brand . Singapore ( edit ) In Singapore , tobacco advertising was completely banned on 1 March 1971 , whereby all kinds of advertising on newspapers and magazines was strictly prohibited , under the Prohibition of Advertisements relating to Smoking Act , 1970 . Tobacco advertisements on radio , television and on neon signs ceased on 31 December 1970 , after which only anti-smoking slogans were permitted to be broadcast on television and radio . With the ban on tobacco advertisements for the purpose of anti-smoking , the Ministry of Culture had appealed to coffee shops , hotels , restaurants , canteens , snack bars and bars to co-operate with the government to remove all posters , signs and other forms of advertisements relating to smoking . A Smoking Advertisement Unit was set up by the Ministry , and officers were located in areas that had any type of tobacco advertisement within the few months before the blanket ban on tobacco advertising kicked off on 1 March 1971 . Twenty - one years later , in 1992 , cigarette advertising in foreign magazines was banned in Singapore . Singapore similarly requires cigarette manufacturers to print images of mouths , feet and blood vessels adversely affected by smoking . Taiwan ( edit ) Article 9 of Taiwan 's `` Tobacco Hazards Prevention Act '' prohibits any form of advertising for any form of tobacco product . Taiwan also prohibits other forms of tobacco promotion , such as `` using tobacco products as gift or prize for the sale of other products or for the promotion of other events , '' or `` packaging tobacco products together with other products for sale . '' Depending on the specific violation , Article 26 penalizes violators with fines ranging from NTD 100,000 to NTD 2,500,000 for each violation .

This ban was extended by the Tobacco Advertising Directive , which took effect in July 2005 to cover other forms of media such as the internet , print media , radio , and sports events like F1 .

Until 1917 , Wilson made minimal preparations for a land war and kept the United States Army on a small peacetime footing , despite increasing demands for enhanced preparedness . He did however expand the United States Navy . In 1917 , with Russia experiencing political upheaval following widespread disillusionment there over the war , and with Britain and France low on credit , Germany appeared to have the upper hand in Europe , while Germany 's ally , the Ottoman Empire , clung stubbornly to its possessions in the Middle East . In the same year , Germany decided to resume unrestricted submarine warfare against any vessel approaching British waters ; this attempt to starve Britain into surrender was balanced against the knowledge that it would almost certainly bring the United States into the war .

Publication of that communique outraged Americans just as German U-boats started sinking American merchant ships in the North Atlantic .

Until 1917 , Wilson made minimal preparations for a land war and kept the United States Army on a small peacetime footing , despite increasing demands fo...",

Development and production ( edit ) Aaron Martin was inspired to write Slasher after his work on the first season of the medical series Saving Hope , including his writing of two Hope episodes where , in his words , `` people got chopped up . '' Martin would write the first episode of Slasher as a spec script , with two intentions for doing so : To offer it to prospective studios , and to show a writing style that was different from his previous work ( e.g. Saving Hope , Degrassi : The Next Generation , Being Erica ) . Though the script did not receive immediate interest , Shaftesbury Films would discover and option it to prospective broadcasters . The script would land at Canadian premium network Super Channel , who , their interest piqued in part by Slasher 's fixed - end format , would order it as a series . The American network Chiller , which specializes in the horror / thriller genre , would join in production sometime after Super Channel ; Slasher would be Chiller 's first foray into original scripted series content . Production on Slasher 's 8 - episode first season was announced on July 28 , 2015 , with filming taking place between then and October 2015 . Three Northern Ontario municipalities -- the cities of Sudbury and Sault Ste . Marie and the town of Parry Sound -- would stand in for the show 's fictitious location , the town of Waterbury . A first trailer for the series would be released on November 26 , 2015 . Unlike most TV series that film their episodes in order , Slasher , under the direction of Craig David Wallace , was shot as if it were a `` super-sized '' movie : Scenes from multiple episodes were shot at the same time , with the availability of locations and cast being factored in . The out - of - order schedule allowed the actors to know of their characters ' fates , especially those who had to film their death scenes one day but return later to film earlier scenes as necessary . As an example of this , Martin cited Mark Ghanim\u00e9 's first day on set , when his character , Justin Faysal , was laid out in a casket for a scene early in Slasher 's third episode ( Justin 's death , which took place in Episode 2 , would be filmed later on ) . On May 1 , 2017 , Slasher began filming a second season in Orangeville , Ontario , Canada . Shaftesbury Films confirmed that the series will not be returning to Super Channel or Chiller for a second season . However , Netflix acquired the rights to the second season . The second season was released via Netflix on October 17 , 2017 . Reception ( edit ) Slasher has received positive reviews . Zap2it called the series `` a whole lot of fun '' and `` something for everyone , '' praising the series ' anthology nature , its cast of characters , storyline , plot twists , bloody violence , and even the series - within - the - series Falcon Husbandry ( shown as a favorite of Robin and Justin 's in Episode 2 ) . Bloody Disgusting awarded the show four skulls out of five , praising Katie McGrath as a great `` protagonist and possible final girl '' and the series ' decision to feature an adult cast , rather than teenagers , with well - developed characters and a `` decidedly classic '' presentation . On the occasion of Slasher 's Super Channel premiere , The Globe and Mail 's John Doyle , while remarking that it `` is no masterpiece of horror , nor was it meant to be , '' called the show `` very well - crafted , '' praising its `` exceptional cast '' and tight pacing , and noting fans of gory horror will appreciate its bloody scenes .

Experiments bombarding uranium with neutrons led Fermi to believe he had created a new , transuranic element , which was dubbed hesperium . But in 1938 , German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann , along with Austrian physicist Lise Meitner and Meitner 's nephew , Otto Robert Frisch , conducted experiments with the products of neutron - bombarded uranium , as a means of further investigating Fermi 's claims . They determined that the relatively tiny neutron split the nucleus of the massive uranium atoms into two roughly equal pieces , contradicting Fermi . This was an extremely surprising result : all other forms of nuclear decay involved only small changes to the mass of the nucleus , whereas this process -- dubbed `` fission '' as a reference to biology -- involved a complete rupture of the nucleus . Numerous scientists , including Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd , who was one of the first , recognized that if fission reactions released additional neutrons , a self - sustaining nuclear chain reaction could result . Once this was experimentally confirmed and announced by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliot - Curie in 1939 , scientists in many countries ( including the United States , the United Kingdom , France , Germany , and the Soviet Union ) petitioned their governments for support of nuclear fission research , just on the cusp of World War II , for the development of a nuclear weapon . First nuclear reactor In the United States , where Fermi and Szil\u00e1rd had both emigrated , this led to the creation of the first man - made reactor , known as Chicago Pile - 1 , which achieved criticality on December 2 , 1942 . This work became part of the Manhattan Project , a massive secret US government military project to make enriched uranium by building large reactors to breed plutonium for use in the first nuclear weapons . The US tested atom bombs and eventually these weapons were used to attack the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki . The first light bulbs ever lit by electricity generated by nuclear power at EBR - 1 at Argonne National Laboratory - West , December 20 , 1951 . In 1945 , the first widely distributed account of nuclear energy , in the form of the pocketbook The Atomic Age , discussed the peaceful future uses of nuclear energy and depicted a future where fossil fuels would go unused . Nobel laurette Glenn Seaborg , who later chaired the Atomic Energy Commission , is quoted as saying `` there will be nuclear powered earth - to - moon shuttles , nuclear powered artificial hearts , plutonium heated swimming pools for SCUBA divers , and much more '' . The United Kingdom , Canada , and the USSR proceeded to research and develop nuclear industries over the course of the late 1940s and early 1950s . Electricity was generated for the first time by a nuclear reactor on December 20 , 1951 , at the EBR - I experimental station near Arco , Idaho , which initially produced about 100 kW . Work was also strongly researched in the US on nuclear marine propulsion , with a test reactor being developed by 1953 ( eventually , the USS Nautilus , the first nuclear - powered submarine , would launch in 1955 ) . In 1953 , US President Dwight Eisenhower gave his `` Atoms for Peace '' speech at the United Nations , emphasizing the need to develop `` peaceful '' uses of nuclear power quickly . This was followed by the 1954 Amendments to the Atomic Energy Act which allowed rapid declassification of US reactor technology and encouraged development by the private sector . Early years On June 27 , 1954 , the USSR 's Obninsk Nuclear Power Plant became the world 's first nuclear power plant to generate electricity for a power grid , and produced around 5 megawatts of electric power . Later in 1954 , Lewis Strauss , then chairman of the United States Atomic Energy Commission ( U.S. AEC , forerunner of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the United States Department of Energy ) spoke of electricity in the future being `` too cheap to meter '' .

In other respects , the quantity and quality of experience are important ; for example , there is substantial evidence that animals raised in enriched environments have thicker cerebral cortices , indicating a higher density of synaptic connections , than animals whose levels of stimulation are restricted . Physiology. The functions of the brain depend on the ability of neurons to transmit electrochemical signals to other cells , and their ability to respond appropriately to electrochemical signals received from other cells . The electrical properties of neurons are controlled by a wide variety of biochemical and metabolic processes , most notably the interactions between neurotransmitters and receptors that take place at synapses . Neurotransmitters and receptors Neurotransmitters are chemicals that are released at synapses when an action potential activates them -- neurotransmitters attach themselves to receptor molecules on the membrane of the synapse 's target cell , and thereby alter the electrical or chemical properties of the receptor molecules . With few exceptions , each neuron in the brain releases the same chemical neurotransmitter , or combination of neurotransmitters , at all the synaptic connections it makes with other neurons ; this rule is known as Dale 's principle . Thus , a neuron can be characterized by the neurotransmitters that it releases . The great majority of psychoactive drugs exert their effects by altering specific neurotransmitter systems . This applies to drugs such as cannabinoids , nicotine , heroin , cocaine , alcohol , fluoxetine , chlorpromazine , and many others . The two neurotransmitters that are used most widely in the vertebrate brain are glutamate , which almost always exerts excitatory effects on target neurons , and gamma - aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) , which is almost always inhibitory . Neurons using these transmitters can be found in nearly every part of the brain . Because of their ubiquity , drugs that act on glutamate or GABA tend to have broad and powerful effects . Some general anesthetics act by reducing the effects of glutamate ; most tranquilizers exert their sedative effects by enhancing the effects of GABA . There are dozens of other chemical neurotransmitters that are used in more limited areas of the brain , often areas dedicated to a particular function . Serotonin , for example -- the primary target of antidepressant drugs and many dietary aids -- comes exclusively from a small brainstem area called the raphe nuclei . Norepinephrine , which is involved in arousal , comes exclusively from a nearby small area called the locus coeruleus . Other neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine and dopamine have multiple sources in the brain , but are not as ubiquitously distributed as glutamate and GABA . Electrical activity Brain electrical activity recorded from a human patient during an epileptic seizure . As a side effect of the electrochemical processes used by neurons for signaling , brain tissue generates electric fields when it is active . When large numbers of neurons show synchronized activity , the electric fields that they generate can be large enough to detect outside the skull , using electroencephalography ( EEG ) or magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) . EEG recordings , along with recordings made from electrodes implanted inside the brains of animals such as rats , show that the brain of a living animal is constantly active , even during sleep . Each part of the brain shows a mixture of rhythmic and nonrhythmic activity , which may vary according to behavioral state . In mammals , the cerebral cortex tends to show large slow delta waves during sleep , faster alpha waves when the animal is awake but inattentive , and chaotic - looking irregular activity when the animal is actively engaged in a task . During an epileptic seizure , the brain 's inhibitory control mechanisms fail to function and electrical activity rises to pathological levels , producing EEG traces that show large wave and spike patterns not seen in a healthy brain . Relating these population - level patterns to the computational functions of individual neurons is a major focus of current research in neurophysiology . Metabolism All vertebrates have a blood -- brain barrier that allows metabolism inside the brain to operate differently from metabolism in other parts of the body . Glial cells play a major role in brain metabolism by controlling the chemical composition of the fluid that surrounds neurons , including levels of ions and nutrients . Brain tissue consumes a large amount of energy in proportion to its volume , so large brains place severe metabolic demands on animals . The need to limit body weight in order , for example , to fly , has apparently led to selection for a reduction of brain size in some species , such as bats . Most of the brain 's energy consumption goes into sustaining the electric charge ( membrane potential ) of neurons . Most vertebrate species devote between 2 % and 8 % of basal metabolism to the brain . In primates , however , the percentage is much higher -- in humans it rises to 20 -- 25 % . The energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time , but active regions of the cerebral cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions ; this forms the basis for the functional brain imaging methods PET , fMRI , and NIRS . The brain typically gets most of its energy from oxygen - dependent metabolism of glucose ( i.e. , blood sugar ) , but ketones provide a major alternative source , together with contributions from medium chain fatty acids ( caprylic and heptanoic acids ) , lactate , acetate , and possibly amino acids . Functions Model of a neural circuit in the cerebellum , as proposed by James S. Albus . Information from the sense organs is collected in the brain .

They were by far the largest vessels of the British shipping company White Star Line 's fleet , which comprised 29 steamers and tenders in 1912 .

A high - powered radiotelegraph transmitter was available for sending passenger `` marconigrams '' and for the ship 's operational use . Although Titanic had advanced safety features such as watertight compartments and remotely activated watertight doors , there were not enough lifeboats to accommodate all of those aboard , due to outdated maritime safety regulations . Titanic only carried enough lifeboats for 1,178 people -- slightly more than half of the number on board , and one third of her total capacity . The ship carried a total of 16 lifeboat davits which could lower three lifeboats each , for a total of 48 boats . However , Titanic carried only a total of 20 lifeboats , four of which were collapsible and proved to be hard to launch during the sinking . After leaving Southampton on 10 April 1912 , Titanic called at Cherbourg in France and Queenstown ( now Cobh ) in Ireland before heading west to New York . On 14 April , four days into the crossing and about 375 miles ( 600 km ) south of Newfoundland , she hit an iceberg at 11 : 40 p.m. ship 's time .

From 1930 to 2002 , there were 4,661 executions in the U.S. , about two - thirds of them in the first 20 years . Additionally , the United States Army executed 135 soldiers between 1916 and 1955 ( the most recent ) . Early Abolition movement ( edit ) Three states abolished the death penalty for murder during the 19th century : Michigan in 1846 ( has never executed a prisoner since achieving statehood ) , Wisconsin in 1853 and Maine in 1887 . Rhode Island is also a state with a long abolitionist background , having repealed the death penalty in 1852 , though it was theoretically available for murder committed by a prisoner between 1872 and 1984 . Other states which abolished the death penalty for murder before Gregg v. Georgia include : Minnesota in 1911 , Vermont in 1964 , Iowa and West Virginia in 1965 and North Dakota in 1973 . Hawaii abolished the death penalty in 1948 and Alaska in 1957 , both before their statehood . Puerto Rico repealed it in 1929 and the District of Columbia in 1981 . Arizona and Oregon abolished the death penalty by popular vote in 1916 and 1964 respectively , but both reinstated it , again by popular vote , some years later : Arizona in 1918 and Oregon in 1978 . Puerto Rico and Michigan are the only two U.S. jurisdictions to have explicitly prohibited capital punishment in their constitutions : in 1952 and 1964 , respectively . Constitutional law developments ( edit ) Nevertheless , capital punishment continued to be used by a majority of states and the federal government for various crimes , especially murder and rape , from the creation of the United States up to the beginning of the 1960s . Until then , `` save for a few mavericks , no one gave any credence to the possibility of ending the death penalty by judicial interpretation of constitutional law '' , according to abolitionist Hugo Bedau . The possibility of challenging the constitutionality of the death penalty became progressively more realistic after the Supreme Court of the United States decided Trop v. Dulles in 1958 , when the court said explicitly for the first time that the Eighth Amendment 's cruel and unusual clause must draw its meaning from the `` evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society '' , rather than from its original meaning . Also in the 1932 case Powell v. Alabama , the court made the first step of what would be later be called `` death is different '' jurisprudence , when it held that any indigent defendant was entitled to a court - appointed attorney in capital cases - a right that was only later extended to non-capital defendants in 1963 , with Gideon v. Wainwright . Capital punishment suspended ( 1972 ) ( edit ) Further information : Furman v. Georgia Executions in the United States since 1960 In Furman v. Georgia , the U.S. Supreme Court considered a group of consolidated cases . The lead case involved an individual convicted under Georgia 's death penalty statute , which featured a `` unitary trial '' procedure in which the jury was asked to return a verdict of guilt or innocence and , simultaneously , determine whether the defendant would be punished by death or life imprisonment .

It included the region 's natural history and illustrations of reptiles , amphibians , birds , and mammals . The report failed however to include detailed topographic maps of potential routes needed to estimate the feasibility , cost and select the best route . The survey was detailed enough to determine that the best southern route lay south of the Gila River boundary with Mexico in mostly vacant desert , through the future territories of Arizona and New Mexico . This in part motivated the United States to complete the Gadsden Purchase . In 1856 the Select Committee on the Pacific Railroad and Telegraph of the US House of Representatives published a report recommending support for a proposed Pacific railroad bill : The necessity that now exists for constructing lines of railroad and telegraphic communication between the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of this continent is no longer a question for argument ; it is conceded by every one . In order to maintain our present position on the Pacific , we must have some more speedy and direct means of intercourse than is at present afforded by the route through the possessions of a foreign power . Possible routes ( edit ) The U.S. Congress was strongly divided on where the eastern terminus of the railroad should be -- in a southern or northern city . Three routes were considered : A northern route roughly along the Missouri River through present - day northern Montana to Oregon Territory . This was considered impractical due to the rough terrain and extensive winter snows . A central route following the Platte River in Nebraska through to the South Pass in Wyoming , following most of the Oregon Trail. Snow on this route remained a concern . A southern route across Texas , New Mexico Territory , the Sonora desert , connecting to Los Angeles , California . Surveyors found during a 1848 survey that the best route lay south of the border between the United States and Mexico . This was resolved by the Gadsden Purchase in 1853 . Once the central route was chosen , it was immediately obvious that the western terminus should be Sacramento . But there was considerable difference of opinion about the eastern terminus . Three locations along 250 miles ( 400 km ) of Missouri River were considered : St. Joseph , Missouri , accessed via the Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad . Kansas City , Kansas / Leavenworth , Kansas accessed via the Leavenworth , Pawnee and Western Railroad , controlled by Thomas Ewing Jr. and later by John C. Fremont . Council Bluffs , Iowa / Omaha , Nebraska , accessed via an extension of Union Pacific financier Thomas C. Durant 's proposed Mississippi and Missouri Railroad and the new Union Pacific Railroad , also controlled by Durant . Council Bluffs had several advantages : It was well north of the Civil War fighting in Missouri ; it was the shortest route to South Pass in the Rockies in Wyoming ; and it would follow a fertile river that would encourage settlement . Durant had hired Lincoln in 1857 when he was an attorney to represent him in a business matter about a bridge over the Missouri . Now Lincoln was responsible for choosing the eastern terminus , and he relied on Durant 's counsel . Durant advocated for Omaha , and he was so confident of the choice that he began buying up land in Nebraska . Key individuals ( edit ) Leland Stanford and the officers of the CPRR in 1870 Asa Whitney ( edit ) One of the most prominent champions of the central route railroad was Asa Whitney . He envisioned a route from Chicago and the Great Lakes to northern California , paid for by the sale of land to settlers along the route . Whitney traveled widely to solicit support from businessmen and politicians , printed maps and pamphlets , and submitted several proposals to Congress , all at his own expense . In June 1845 , he led a team along part of the proposed route to assess its feasibility . Legislation to begin construction of the Pacific Railroad ( called the Memorial of Asa Whitney ) was first introduced to Congress by Representative Zadock Pratt . Congress did not immediately act on Whitney 's proposal . Theodore Judah ( edit ) Main article : Theodore Judah Theodore Judah , architect of the Transcontinental Railroad and first chief engineer of the Central Pacific . Lewis M. Clement , Chief Assistant Engineer and Superintendent of Track The next big champion of the central route was Theodore Judah , who undertook to survey a manageable route through what was one of the chief obstacles of a central route to California , the high and rugged Sierra Nevada . In 1852 , Judah was chief engineer for the newly formed Sacramento Valley Railroad , the first railroad built west of the Mississippi River . Although the railroad later went bankrupt once the easy placer gold deposits around Placerville , California were depleted , Judah was convinced that a properly financed railroad could pass from Sacramento through the Sierra Nevada mountains to reach the Great Basin and hook up with rail lines coming from the East . In 1856 , Judah wrote a 13,000 - word proposal in support of a Pacific railroad and distributed it to Cabinet secretaries , congressmen and other influential people . In September 1859 , Judah was chosen to be the accredited lobbyist for the Pacific Railroad Convention , which indeed approved his plan to survey , finance and engineer the road . Judah returned to Washington in December 1859 . He had a lobbying office in the United States Capitol , received an audience with President James Buchanan , and represented the Convention before Congress . Judah returned to California in 1860 . He continued to search for a more practical route through the Sierra suitable for a railroad . In mid-1860 , local miner Daniel Strong had surveyed a route over the Sierra for a wagon toll road , which he realized would also suit a railroad . He described his discovery in a letter to Judah .

          "full_text": "For example , in the 17th century , the solar cycle appeared to have stopped entirely for several decades ; few sunspots were observed during a period known as the Maunder minimum . This coincided in time with the era of the Little Ice Age , when Europe experienced unusually cold temperatures . Earlier extended minima have been discovered through analysis of tree rings and appear to have coincided with lower - than - average global temperatures . A recent theory claims that there are magnetic instabilities in the core of the Sun that cause fluctuations with periods of either 41,000 or 100,000 years . These could provide a better explanation of the ice ages than the Milankovitch cycles . Life phases Main articles : Formation and evolution of the Solar System and Stellar evolution The Sun today is roughly halfway through the most stable part of its life . It has not changed dramatically for over four billion years , and will remain fairly stable for more than five billion more . However , after hydrogen fusion in its core has stopped , the Sun will undergo severe changes , both internally and externally . Formation The Sun formed about 4.6 billion years ago from the collapse of part of a giant molecular cloud that consisted mostly of hydrogen and helium and that probably gave birth to many other stars . This age is estimated using computer models of stellar evolution and through nucleocosmochronology . The result is consistent with the radiometric date of the oldest Solar System material , at 4.567 billion years ago . Studies of ancient meteorites reveal traces of stable daughter nuclei of short - lived isotopes , such as iron - 60 , that form only in exploding , short - lived stars . This indicates that one or more supernovae must have occurred near the location where the Sun formed . A shock wave from a nearby supernova would have triggered the formation of the Sun by compressing the matter within the molecular cloud and causing certain regions to collapse under their own gravity . As one fragment of the cloud collapsed it also began to rotate because of conservation of angular momentum and heat up with the increasing pressure . Much of the mass became concentrated in the center , whereas the rest flattened out into a disk that would become the planets and other Solar System bodies . Gravity and pressure within the core of the cloud generated a lot of heat as it accreted more matter from the surrounding disk , eventually triggering nuclear fusion . Thus , the Sun was born . Main sequence Evolution of the Sun 's luminosity , radius and effective temperature compared to the present Sun . After Ribas ( 2010 ) The Sun is about halfway through its main - sequence stage , during which nuclear fusion reactions in its core fuse hydrogen into helium . Each second , more than four million tonnes of matter are converted into energy within the Sun 's core , producing neutrinos and solar radiation . At this rate , the Sun has so far converted around 100 times the mass of Earth into energy , about 0.03 % of the total mass of the Sun . The Sun will spend a total of approximately 10 billion years as a main - sequence star . The Sun is gradually becoming hotter during its time on the main sequence , because the helium atoms in the core occupy less volume than the hydrogen atoms that were fused . The core is therefore shrinking , allowing the outer layers of the Sun to move closer to the centre and experience a stronger gravitational force , according to the inverse - square law . This stronger force increases the pressure on the core , which is resisted by a gradual increase in the rate at which fusion occurs . This process speeds up as the core gradually becomes denser . It is estimated that the Sun has become 30 % brighter in the last 4.5 billion years . At present , it is increasing in brightness by about 1 % every 100 million years . After core hydrogen exhaustion The size of the current Sun ( now in the main sequence ) compared to its estimated size during its red - giant phase in the future The Sun does not have enough mass to explode as a supernova . Instead it will exit the main sequence in approximately 5 billion years and start to turn into a red giant . As a red giant , the Sun will grow so large that it will engulf Mercury , Venus , and probably Earth . Even before it becomes a red giant , the luminosity of the Sun will have nearly doubled , and Earth will receive as much sunlight as Venus receives today .",
          "text_preview": "For example , in the 17th century , the solar cycle appeared to have stopped entirely for several decades ; few sunspots were observed during a period known as the Maunder minimum . This coincided in time with the era of the Little Ice Age , when Europe experienced unusually cold temperatures .

As a red giant , the Sun will grow so large that it will engulf Mercury , Venus , and probably Earth . Even before it becomes a red giant , the luminosity of the Sun will have nearly doubled , and Earth will receive as much sunlight as Venus receives today . Once the core hydrogen is exhausted in 5.4 billion years , the Sun will expand into a subgiant phase and slowly double in size over about half a billion years . It will then expand more rapidly over about half a billion years until it is over two hundred times larger than today and a couple of thousand times more luminous . This then starts the red - giant - branch phase where the Sun will spend around a billion years and lose around a third of its mass . Evolution of a Sun - like star . The track of a one solar mass star on the Hertzsprung -- Russell diagram is shown from the main sequence to the post-asymptotic - giant - branch stage . After the red - giant branch the Sun has approximately 120 million years of active life left , but much happens . First , the core , full of degenerate helium ignites violently in the helium flash , where it is estimated that 6 % of the core , itself 40 % of the Sun 's mass , will be converted into carbon within a matter of minutes through the triple - alpha process . The Sun then shrinks to around 10 times its current size and 50 times the luminosity , with a temperature a little lower than today . It will then have reached the red clump or horizontal branch , but a star of the Sun 's mass does not evolve blueward along the horizontal branch . Instead , it just becomes moderately larger and more luminous over about 100 million years as it continues to burn helium in the core . When the helium is exhausted , the Sun will repeat the expansion it followed when the hydrogen in the core was exhausted , except that this time it all happens faster , and the Sun becomes larger and more luminous . This is the asymptotic - giant - branch phase , and the Sun is alternately burning hydrogen in a shell or helium in a deeper shell . After about 20 million years on the early asymptotic giant branch , the Sun becomes increasingly unstable , with rapid mass loss and thermal pulses that increase the size and luminosity for a few hundred years every 100,000 years or so . The thermal pulses become larger each time , with the later pulses pushing the luminosity to as much as 5,000 times the current level and the radius to over 1 AU . According to a 2008 model , Earth 's orbit is shrinking due to tidal forces ( and , eventually , drag from the lower chromosphere ) , so that it will be engulfed by the Sun near the tip of the red giant branch phase , 1 and 3.8 million years after Mercury and Venus have respectively suffered the same fate . Models vary depending on the rate and timing of mass loss . Models that have higher mass loss on the red - giant branch produce smaller , less luminous stars at the tip of the asymptotic giant branch , perhaps only 2,000 times the luminosity and less than 200 times the radius . For the Sun , four thermal pulses are predicted before it completely loses its outer envelope and starts to make a planetary nebula . ",

'' Wonder Woman 's advocacy for gay rights was taken a step further in September 2016 , when comic book writer Greg Rucka announced that she is canonically bisexual , according to her rebooted Rebirth origin . Rucka stated that in his opinion , she `` has to be '' queer and has `` obviously '' had same - sex relationships on an island surrounded by beautiful women . This follows the way Wonder Woman was written in the alternate continuity or non-canon Earth One by Grant Morrison , and fellow Wonder Woman writer Gail Simone staunchly supported Rucka 's statement . Surprised at the amount of backlash from her fanbase , Rucka responded to `` haters '' that consensual sex with women is just as important to Wonder Woman as the Truth is to Superman . Wonder Woman actress Gal Gadot reacted positively to Diana 's rebooted orientation , and agreed her sexuality was impacted by growing up in the women - only Themyscira .

In 1982 , the Toyota Motor Company and Toyota Motor Sales merged into one company , the Toyota Motor Corporation . Two years later , Toyota entered into a joint venture with General Motors called the New United Motor Manufacturing , Inc , NUMMI , operating an automobile - manufacturing plant in Fremont , California . The factory was an old General Motors plant that had been closed for two years . Toyota then started to establish new brands at the end of the 1980s , with the launch of their luxury division Lexus in 1989 . 1990s ( edit ) In the 1990s , Toyota began to branch out from producing mostly compact cars by adding many larger and more luxurious vehicles to its lineup , including a full - sized pickup , the T100 ( and later the Tundra ) , several lines of SUVs , a sport version of the Camry , known as the Camry Solara , and the Scion brand . They would also launch newer and arguably more iconic iterations of their sports cars , namely the MR2 , Celica , and Supra during this era , all of which have already become icons of the 1990s . With a major presence in Europe , due to the success of Toyota Team Europe , the corporation decided to set up Toyota Motor Europe Marketing and Engineering , TMME , to help market vehicles in the continent . Two years later , Toyota set up a base in the United Kingdom , TMUK , as the company 's cars had become very popular among British drivers . Bases in Indiana , Virginia , and Tianjin were also set up . In 1999 , the company decided to list itself on the New York and London Stock Exchanges . 2000s ( edit ) In 2001 , Toyota 's Toyo Trust and Banking merged with two other banks to form UFJ Bank , which was accused of corruption by Japan 's government for making bad loans to alleged Yakuza crime syndicates with executives accused of blocking Financial Service Agency inspections . The UFJ was listed among Fortune Magazine 's largest money - losing corporations in the world , with Toyota 's chairman serving as a director . At the time , the UFJ was one of the largest shareholders of Toyota . As a result of Japan 's banking crisis , UFJ merged with the Bank of Tokyo - Mitsubishi to become the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group . In 2002 , Toyota managed to enter a Formula One works team and establish joint ventures with French motoring companies Citro\u00ebn and Peugeot a year after Toyota started producing cars in France . Toyota ranked eighth on Forbes 2000 list of the world 's leading companies for the year 2005 but slid to 55 for 2011 . The company was number one in global automobile sales for the first quarter of 2008 . In 2007 , Toyota released an update of its full - sized truck , the Tundra , produced in two American factories , one in Texas and one in Indiana . Motor Trend named the Tundra `` Truck of the Year '' , and the 2007 Toyota Camry `` Car of the Year '' for 2007 . It also began the construction of two new factories , one to build the RAV4 in Woodstock , Ontario , Canada , and the other to build the Toyota Prius in Blue Springs , Mississippi , USA .

George Whitefield and John 's brother Charles Wesley were also significant early leaders in the movement . It originated as a revival within the 18th century Church of England and became a separate denomination after Wesley 's death . The movement spread throughout the British Empire , the United States , and beyond because of vigorous missionary work , today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide . Wesley 's theology focused on sanctification and the effect of faith on the character of a Christian . Distinguishing Methodist doctrines include an assurance of salvation , imparted righteousness , the possibility of perfection in love , the works of piety , and the primacy of Scripture . Most Methodists teach that Jesus Christ , the Son of God , died for all of humanity and that salvation is available for all ; in theology , this view is known as Arminianism . This teaching rejects the Calvinist position that God has pre-ordained the salvation of a select group of people . However , Whitefield and several others were considered Calvinistic Methodists and held to the Calvinistic position . Methodism emphasises charity and support for the sick , the poor , and the afflicted through the works of mercy . These ideals are put into practice by the establishment of hospitals , orphanages , soup kitchens , and schools to follow Christ 's command to spread the gospel and serve all people . The movement has a wide variety of forms of worship , ranging from high church to low church in liturgical usage . Denominations that descend from the British Methodist tradition are generally less ritualistic , while American Methodism is more so , the United Methodist Church in particular . Methodism is known for its rich musical tradition , and Charles Wesley was instrumental in writing much of the hymnody of the Methodist Church . Early Methodists were drawn from all levels of society , including the aristocracy , but the Methodist preachers took the message to labourers and criminals who tended to be left outside organised religion at that time . In Britain , the Methodist Church had a major effect in the early decades of the developing working class ( 1760 -- 1820 ) . In the United States , it became the religion of many slaves who later formed `` black churches '' in the Methodist tradition .

The largest of these were the Primitive Methodist church , deriving from a revival at Mow Cop in Staffordshire , the Bible Christians and the Methodist New Connexion . The original church became known as the Wesleyan Methodist Church to distinguish it from these bodies . In 1907 , a union of smaller groups with the Methodist New Connexion and Bible Christian Church brought about the United Methodist Church ( Great Britain ) , then the three major streams of British Methodism united in 1932 to form the current Methodist Church of Great Britain . The fourth - largest denomination in the country , the Methodist Church of Great Britain has about 202,000 members in 4,650 congregations . Wesley 's Chapel in London was established by John Wesley , whose statue stands in the courtyard . Early Methodism was particularly prominent in Devon and Cornwall , which were key centers of activity by the Bible Christian faction of Methodists . The Bible Christians produced many preachers , and sent many missionaries to Australia . Methodism also grew rapidly in the old mill towns of Yorkshire and Lancashire , where the preachers stressed that the working classes were equal to the upper classes in the eyes of God . In Wales , three elements separately welcomed Methodism : Welsh - speaking , English - speaking , and Calvinistic . British Methodists , in particular the Primitive Methodists , took a leading role in the temperance movement of the 19th and early 20th centuries . Methodists saw alcoholic beverages , and alcoholism , as the root of many social ills and tried to persuade people to abstain from these .

Methodist churches do not adhere to a single definitive statement or `` confession '' of belief , unlike the Westminster Confession used by Reformed churches or the Augsburg Confession used by Lutheran churches . Many Methodist bodies , such as the African Methodist Episcopal Church and the United Methodist Church , base their doctrinal standards on Wesley 's Articles of Religion , an abridgment of the Thirty - nine Articles of the Church of England that excised its Calvinist features . Some Methodist denominations also publish catechisms , which concisely summarise Christian doctrine . Methodists generally accept the Apostles ' Creed and the Nicene Creed as declarations of shared Christian faith . Methodism also affirms the traditional Christian belief in the triune Godhead : Father , Son and Holy Spirit , as well as the orthodox understanding of the consubstantial humanity and divinity of Jesus Christ . Methodism is evangelical in doctrine and is characterized by Wesleyan - Arminian theology . John Wesley is studied by Methodists for his interpretation of church practice and doctrine . At its heart , the theology of John Wesley stressed the life of Christian holiness : to love God with all one 's heart , mind , soul and strength and to love one 's neighbour as oneself . One popular expression of Methodist doctrine is in the hymns of Charles Wesley . Since enthusiastic congregational singing was a part of the early evangelical movement , Wesleyan theology took root and spread through this channel . Salvation ( edit ) Methodists believe Jesus Christ died for all humanity , not a limited few : the doctrine of unlimited atonement . Wesleyan Methodists identify with the Arminian conception of free will , as opposed to the theological determinism of absolute predestination . Methodism teaches that salvation is entirely a work of God alone with no work by which it can be earned ( monergism ) , and that one can not either turn to God nor believe unless God has first drawn a person and implanted the desire in their heart ( the Wesleyan doctrine of prevenient grace ) . Methodists interpret Scripture as teaching that the saving work of Jesus Christ is for all people ( unlimited atonement ) but effective only to those who respond and believe , in accordance with the Reformation principles of sola gratia ( grace alone ) and sola fide ( faith alone ) . John Wesley taught four key points fundamental to Methodism : A person is free not only to reject salvation but also to accept it by an act of free will . All people who are obedient to the gospel according to the measure of knowledge given them will be saved . The Holy Spirit assures a Christian of their salvation directly , through an inner `` experience '' ( assurance of salvation ) . Christians in this life are capable of Christian perfection and are commanded by God to pursue it . ",

Preparation required longer than the two hours scheduled . Armstrong initially had some difficulties squeezing through the hatch with his Portable Life Support System ( PLSS ) . According to veteran Moon - walker John Young , a redesign of the LM to incorporate a smaller hatch had not been followed by a redesign of the PLSS backpack , so some of the highest heart rates recorded from Apollo astronauts occurred during LM egress and ingress . Several books indicate early mission timelines had Buzz Aldrin rather than Neil Armstrong as the first man on the Moon . At 02 : 39 UTC on Monday July 21 , 1969 , Armstrong opened the hatch , and at 02 : 51 UTC began his descent to the lunar surface . The Remote Control Unit controls on his chest kept him from seeing his feet . Climbing down the nine - rung ladder , Armstrong pulled a D - ring to deploy the Modular Equipment Stowage Assembly ( MESA ) folded against Eagle 's side and activate the TV camera , and at 02 : 56 : 15 UTC he set his left foot on the surface .

At 02 : 39 UTC on Monday July 21 , 1969 , Armstrong opened the hatch , and at 02 : 51 UTC began his descent to the lunar surface . The Remote Control Unit controls on his chest kept him from seeing his feet . Climbing down the nine - rung ladder , Armstrong pulled a D - ring to deploy the Modular Equipment Stowage Assembly ( MESA ) folded against Eagle 's side and activate the TV camera , and at 02 : 56 : 15 UTC he set his left foot on the surface . The first landing used slow - scan television incompatible with commercial TV , so it was displayed on a special monitor and a conventional TV camera viewed this monitor , significantly reducing the quality of the picture . The signal was received at Goldstone in the United States but with better fidelity by Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station in Australia . Minutes later the feed was switched to the more sensitive Parkes radio telescope in Australia . Despite some technical and weather difficulties , ghostly black and white images of the first lunar EVA were received and broadcast to at least 600 million people on Earth . Although copies of this video in broadcast format were saved and are widely available , recordings of the original slow scan source transmission from the lunar surface were accidentally destroyed during routine magnetic tape re-use at NASA . The plaque left on the ladder of Eagle While still on the ladder , Armstrong uncovered a plaque mounted on the LM descent stage bearing two drawings of Earth ( of the Western and Eastern Hemispheres ) , an inscription , and signatures of the astronauts and President Nixon . The inscription read : Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon , July 1969 A.D. We came in peace for all mankind . After describing the surface dust as `` very fine - grained '' and `` almost like a powder , '' six and a half hours after landing , Armstrong stepped off Eagle 's footpad and declared , `` That 's one small step for ( a ) man , one giant leap for mankind . '' Armstrong intended to say `` That 's one small step for a man '' , but the word `` a '' is not audible in the transmission , and thus was not initially reported by most observers of the live broadcast . When later asked about his quote , Armstrong said he believed he said `` for a man '' , and subsequent printed versions of the quote included the `` a '' in square brackets . One explanation for the absence may be that his accent caused him to slur the words `` for a '' together ; another is the intermittent nature of the audio and video links to Earth , partly because of storms near Parkes Observatory . More recent digital analysis of the tape claims to reveal the `` a '' may have been spoken but obscured by static . That 's one small step ... Problems playing this file ? ",

Mission commander Neil Armstrong and pilot Buzz Aldrin , both American , landed the lunar module Eagle on July 20 , 1969 , at 20 : 18 UTC . Armstrong became the first human to step onto the lunar surface six hours after landing on July 21 at 02 : 56 : 15 UTC ; Aldrin joined him about 20 minutes later . They spent about two and a quarter hours together outside the spacecraft , and collected 47.5 pounds ( 21.5 kg ) of lunar material to bring back to Earth . Michael Collins piloted the command module Columbia alone in lunar orbit while they were on the Moon 's surface . Armstrong and Aldrin spent just under a day on the lunar surface before rejoining Columbia in lunar orbit . Apollo 11 was launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island , Florida , on July 16 at 9 : 32 am EDT ( 13 : 32 UTC ) and was the fifth manned mission of NASA 's Apollo program . The Apollo spacecraft had three parts : a command module ( CM ) with a cabin for the three astronauts , and the only part that returned to Earth ; a service module ( SM ) , which supported the command module with propulsion , electrical power , oxygen , and water ; and a lunar module ( LM ) that had two stages -- a descent stage for landing on the Moon , and an ascent stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit . After being sent to the Moon by the Saturn V 's third stage , the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit . Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the lunar module Eagle and landed in the Sea of Tranquility . ",

The line `` do n't be a macho man '' is said to express Jackson 's dislike of violence , whilst also referring to the childhood abuse he faced at the hands of his father Joseph . The song is played in the key of E \u266d minor at a moderately fast tempo of 138 -- 139 beats per minute . In the song , Jackson 's vocal range is B3 to D5 . Drums on the song were played by Toto co-founder Jeff Porcaro . A remix of `` 2 Bad '' , is featured on Blood on the Dance Floor : HIStory in the Mix containing a sample of `` Beat It '' as well as a rap by John Fort\u00e9 and guitar solo by Wyclef Jean .

The aerodynamic metal flight pumped crossover fuel that would boost the success of Thriller -- a gimmick Jackson would flog later with spots from Slash and Carlos Santana .
